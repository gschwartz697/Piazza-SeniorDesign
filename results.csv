"	Hello! I've looked at the Piazza posts and even actually asked a private post about this but still can't fix the issue (although I think I now identified it).

I think the reason why my thickness toggle is also making the borders thick is because I change the thickness of the entire paint.thickness thick so that when we repaint, the borders all come out as thick. 

I am stuck on how to fix that issue, namely, how to just change the thickness of the things being drawn in the canvas and not the other widgets. (For some weird reason only my borders are being drawn that way.. probably because they are being drawn in paint.m;)  I've command'f ed all the places that color goes into and made sure that my thickness behaves the same. I also add new shapes to the deque with current thickness and draw them each with the correct thickness. I've been stuck on this for quite a while, but would it be possible to receive a bit of help to identify where I am making a mistake? It would help tremendously if someone could look at my code :( Sorry if it's a bit much I am asking. 

Thank You! "

In my understanding the input should just be a helix list (ex [gorilla; chimp]), so I don't quite understand why it leads to a test failure.

Thanks!	For the test case where there are two Mets in a row, should only the first one be added?	Test cases for which there are no triplets that result in a start codon (Met) would just return the empty list [ ]?	I am working on the decreasing_similarity function and am not sure how to handle cases when two consecutive elements have the same similarity. For example, if I test the list [gorilla; gorilla; orangutan] should that return true or false?	If we have a test that fails after submitting our homework, will we ever be able to find out what specific test case it fails for or is that something we need to ask about in person?	My insert has passed all the test cases I have written so far. Did I not translate my intuition correctly to the implementation?	we dont have to test debug_name right?	when we are creating test cases for setTest, our final line for our tests should be like: equals s1 s2  instead of s1 = s2 right?	Ok so our test cases should cater to the ol sets and thus the invariances of such structure which includes the fact that the sets must be ordered and all elements unique right?	I wrote a fold function for exists and it made the test cases that were provided for us have errors. Anything I should be looking out for to fix this? I am unsure what the cause could be... my error is over the 0 is x&gt;0 and it says that this is an int value and it's expecting a bool 	The given test case for 42 being in assoc list returns ""should fail"". I was going to return something different for the failwith since errors are usually supposed to tell you why something failed. Is it okay to edit the test case to return the error message I was planning on using in my function, or should I have the fxn conform to this?	This is one of the test cases that was already written in problem 1, what exactly is it doing? Seeing if the strings are a boolean that is false? What wouldn't this throw a type error?
let test () : bool =
  filter' (fun _ -&gt; false) [""a""; ""b""; ""c""] = []
;; run_test ""filter': multiple elements; all are filtered"" test
	
I double checked my function — for reference, this is my function and the test cases. 	Is there any way to test whether the output of string_of_counts is correct?	Are we meant to write our own BSTs to test the lookup function or are there some which exist already in the files?	In our test cases, should all of the sets we are inputting already be in ascending order and without duplicates?	For setTest, I am using int sets for all my test cases. Is this ok? I remembered somewhere earlier in the assignment it stated that if we can prove a generic function works for ints it will work everything. Is it bad style to not try any other data type?	My test cases have code specific to being an int, but the implementation of my functions will not. This is ok right? I tried writing test cases with 'x for example and got errors.	I am having the same problem and I do not know how looking at the combine function will help me make the test pass?	I'm trying write test cases but they are not being ""run"" by the terminal. My old test cases are running? What's going on?	So in my test case for remove for TreeSet I am hitting a fail with when I run the test case for remove but the only way I should hit a fail with is if a empty set is passed into my treemax function and I already accounted for that in my pattern matching so there should be literally no way that that happens. I've double checked everything several times and I've compared with the lecture and literally everything checks out. Is this a codio error or am I missing something? Everything else works just fine	All of my test cases seem to be passing even when I delete the body of the function I'm working on. Is there any reason this might be happening?	On Problem 3:

A prewritten test that I didn't touch for equality_test_results is giving me an error since it is expecting a 'a ref but the test calls for a 'a ref option


My code isn't compiling because of it. Anyone else have the same problem?	Should we fail in these cases or just do nothing? or up to us how we want to implement it? 	Would the correct interpretation of queueTest be that we only have to add testcases for truncate and delete? i.e. all the other functions have complete test cases?
	For some reason on line 84 of my imp.ml code my test case itself is giving me an error - any idea why?	According to the instructions and if I comprehend right, we have to write test cases only for truncate and delete - correct?	I wrote the code into my codio file and tried a test case on it but it's returning the empty case. Did I write the incorrect test?

  let test () : bool =    let q = [""abc""; ""b""; ""c""] in    shortest_aux q = (""b"", 1)  ;; run_test ""shortest_aux"" test              
	When I submit, it says this is the test that I failed. Shouldn't this be caught in the very first line of the function as invalid?	All my test cases are passing except when elt is the last element, but I can't find what's wrong with it. Help :( 	Basically, I submitted my code, then didn't make a single change but pretty much all my test cases are failing now as opposed to before when all of them passed for deque. I'm wondering if there's a way I can restore my code to the version I submitted.	I did draw out the ASM for the test case that is failing. The pointers seem to all be correct... I do not understand what is happening.	The code does compile, but the function fails test cases that require assignment (the ""else n.next &lt;- None; q.tail &lt;- g"" portion), I believe. For example, it fails 
  let test () : bool =     let q = from_list [1; 2; 3] in    truncate 3 q;    to_list q = [1; 2; 3]  ;; run_test ""truncate last element returns same queue"" test

	let test () : bool = join_option (Some (Some 3)) = Some 3;; run_test ""join_option Some option"" test  

I am getting error here and can't test my other code. What should I do to remove this? It was fine earlier. 	Whenever I test insert_head, I get an error saying there's an invalid queue, but I feel like I'm satisfying all the invariants. Is there anyway to test which ones I am not satisfying?  
	My test cases for reverse keep running an 'out of memory' error. What is causing this?	Two of my test cases for delete_last ""out of memory"" error. Any idea what is causing this? 	For 4c, would it be ok to write not (mem 1 m2) since we already removed the key 1 in part b? Basically, does what we do in the tests before hold for the tests afterward? 

Also for part 4d, 
would this be a valid test to see if a key is a member? 
let test () = 
add 3 ""q"" m1; 
mem 3 m1
;;run test ""ley is member after adding"" test 	does run failing test only succeed if the function provides a fail with? or does run failing test also succeed when the given test's boolean returns false but not a failwith (incorrect test output)?	i think i am having a similar problem with either vpair or vlist-- i see many black lines after i edit the layout, but both vpair and vlist passed all of the test cases. how can i trace my errors?	Do size and repaint affect the outcome of the test cases? Or is that should handle	Hi Professor, 

I am really struggling with the test portion of this class. I feel as though I generally understand the material and do well on the homeworks, but I just cannot seem to get test answers correct. 

This was confirmed by my test grade, but I also realized this while studying, realizing that I was doing poorly on all the practice midterms. 

I am really putting a lot of effort in and I think a lot of it is that I am generally a bad test taker. For example, I think I could have gotten the last question on the test correct except that I took way too much time on the quadrant one and didn't leave myself enough time to think the last one through.

However, I also think there is some fundamental misunderstanding going on. I have been going to office hours a lot trying to clear things up, but the queue is always so long, it is impossible to get help. Because of my other classes, I can rarely go before Sunday  (I have class Wednesday and Thursday until 7:30) and by that time it is so crowded. 

I have also looked into tutoring services, but they are impossible to get in to and every time I have checked, they have been unavailable. 

I really want to succeed in this class and I am feeling at a loss on how to do so. Obviously getting a 36% on the first midterm is not super helpful so I guess the question I am proposing to you is twofold -- One, is there anyway I can do any kind of make up to try to prove that I understand more than I demonstrated initially on the test and get some of those points back? And, two, whether or not I can get points back, how do you suggest I move forward so that I can do better in the future? 

Let me know what your thoughts are. 	I think I covered all of the cases
	For my make_control function, the only test that's failing is the change_value test where the value is changed from 1 to 2. Currently, the value apparently doesn't change, could anyone help see why? Thanks	I've gathered that much but I can't figure out what's wrong with my change listener since I can't test it on its own 	For some reason, my code is not recognizing the Assert and Test classes. 
Does this have to do with error at the bottom where it says Descriptions?

	For some reason, whatever implantation I use (I’ve tried three alternate techniques, any pixel I create has an r value of 0 and this fails my test cases. Is there anything I’m missing that might be causing this to happen? 	My test took 1.531. Is this ok?	Do we need to test getRed(), getBlue(), etc?

It is already used in the other test cases.

Thanks!	I'm having the same issue, MyTest fails all test cases even though I've written several tests for Pixel and they seem to be passing (ManipulateTest also works, as does the GUI).	I'm trying to test my rotateCCW and border functions but when I run MyTest it only seems to run testRotateCW and nothing else.

How do I fix this? Also how do I go about printing out the actual picture to visually test the effects of the functions ... can I just use the PixelPicture.print() method?	“Editor does not contain a main type” Should I write a main function that calls something like Pixel Test?	I've redone my function and it passes interesting test but not trivial test--Screen_Shot_20181029_at_10.24.42_PM.png	Which test file holds the tests for this RotateCCW? In ManipulateTest, there is only a test for RotateCW. If it doesn't exist, how would we go about generating a test for it?	The test for rotateCW fails even though that one was already written. Why is this happening?

	The only test in MyPixelTest that's failing is my getComponents test. In my function, I'm using the Arrays.copyof() function in order to not break encapsulation. 

I'm just really confused why my test is failing because I'm just using AssertTrue and then comparing the pixel's get components method to what my array is supposed to look like (using the .equals method).	On eclipse, my code compiles fine and all the test cases pass. However, when I try to submit it says I have a compilation error and my homework status is not submitted even after I hit submit. What can I do?

compilation_failure.PNG	For tests can we write tests that have a bunch of assertEquals statements like in the example test given where it looked at getRed, getBlue, and getGreen, or should each test only look at exactly one thing?

For example, I wrote a new test for each fxn, but like my test for getRed has 3 assertEquals jawns that check make sure it returns values in [0,255] if it's out of bounds on either side, and return the normal value if it's in bounds. 	I implemented by blur function and it seems to be working on the GUI, but it doesn't pass the test in ManipulateTest.java... I accounted for edge cases as well, any suggestions on how to find where it's going wrong? 	So, I completed all the tasks in Pixel.java and tested quite extensively with test cases and it seemed like all the tests passed. But RotateCW results in a Black rectangle, which leads me to believe that something is wrong in the constructors in Pixel.java.I have tried to run through the file multiple times, but couldn't find anything wrong. I have copy pasted my code and test cases in the Codio and was wondering if it would be possible to get any help on where I'm going wrong.	My test cases for grayScaleAverage() all pass, but when I try to apply the effect on Pennstagram, a popup says that the effect is not implemented yet. But my other effects like colorInvert work. Is something wrong with my code? 	I'm confused - when I try to run it is not working. I put @Test on every test I wrote, and I checked Pixel and MyPixelTest when running. Is there anything I can do on the page below? Thanks!	Yes I had @Test written above all the test cases.	I am getting the following error, so my MyTest test cases are not running. My ManipulateTest cases are running so I don't think this has to do with the build path. 

	Do we only test &amp; write the test cases for functions in ""Pixel""? Not simple or advanced manipulations? (Grading wise)	I am still having an issue where all my test cases in manipulateTest and myTest are passing even when my functions are not implemented. I have transferred all my work over from Eclipse to Codio and nothing has changed. My issue is probably in the Pixel class but I really can not find my error, please help!	I'm not sure why but my blur function is passing ManipulationTest but not MyTest. Could this be something wrong with my edge cases, or is there something else I need to consider?	My blur function works fine, but the test is still failing? What could be a possible reason for this?	Why the test will not produce a new local stream s? Since the line

I've tested every file reader input that I can think of, but when the compiler runs this test upon submission, I get a FormatException. 

Currently, I'm reading each line, parsing the substring before the first comma into a ""typo"" String, and then parsing the substring after the comma into a ""correctedWord"" String.

For example, for problem #3, the direction will either be ""forward"" or ""backward"". What if the user inputs ""abcdeg"" or 256? What if num_moves is negative?

Each problem will specify the range of inputs that your function should be able to handle, through either the type signature or comments in the file. If an input falls outside of this range (i.e. “abcdeg”) then your code may do anything it likes. Our test cases will not run your function with such inputs. 

I would like to think this rule applies, but the problem doesn't specify a range of inputs.	Thank you! Could you please clarify what it is I need to uncomment? I had tried commenting out all of problem 7 to move on to problem 8 (Should that be possible?) Anyway, I removed the comment notation I added originally and still can't run the program.	Is the function supposed to fail when we feed it unsorted lists?	I remember seeing somewhere that we did not have to use recursion for the earlier problems. Does that mean we also do not have to use things like min and max as it is a hint if we prefer to use another way of solving the problem such as if-else statements?

I'm doing a pattern matching on a value that is created using modulo, so could only possibly have certain values (eg, x mod 2, where x is a nonnegative integer, must be 0 or 1).

Codio seems not to recognize this and is warning that the pattern matching is not exhaustive.  It suggests an example value that isn't covered (in example above, it would be suggesting 2, but clearly x mod 2 &lt;&gt; 2).

Should I ignore this warning?  Is it good or bad style to add a pattern:  | _ -&gt; failwith "".."" just to make the warning go away even if the warning is irrelevant?

Should we expect inputs with repeated elements, i.e. [1;2;2;3]? Are we expected to handle the repetitions coming with these cases?	So I think I understand the logic of this question but I'm not sure. I was able to make code that passes the four test cases given by using an if statement block that check the heads and tails of both lists and does things depending on the values. However it fails when the code is something like [2;3;1] and [1;2;3;1;5]
it doesnt work because it doesnt know it matches.

I don't think so...what I mean is the first function call computes t1's complexity to compare to t2's, and then if t1 is simpler, the recursive call needs to compare t1 to t3 and so on, so it seems that t1's complexity is recomputed every time it's the simpler one in a comparison.

Thanks,
Alex Kassouni	For add_ancestor_labels, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to extract just the two children of any given node in order to apply guess_parent_helix. Is there a helper method for figuring this out or what kind of approach should I be taking?	None of the suggestions on @52 are helping me - what should I do?	For question 2, I have this code for one of my match statements which I believe is correct thus far:

let hamm_count = 0 in
  begin match x1, x2 with
  |_,[]-&gt; 0
  |[],_-&gt; 0
  |hd1::tl1,hd2::tl2-&gt; if hd1 = hd2 then hamming_distance tl1 tl2 
    else hamm_count + 1 + hamming_distance tl1 tl2
  end
However in trying to simplify my final match statement with Boolean operators, 

(hd1 = hd2 &amp;&amp; hamming_distance tl1 tl2) || (hamm_count + 1 + hamming_distance tl1 tl2)

I get the error, this expression is type int but is expecting type bool and vice versa. What could I be missing?
	For the decreasing_similarity function should it return true if there are two of the same helices? 	Are midterms at night? If so, what time? 	Do we need to account for if the list of helices repeats certain helices? I'm thinking that if there are repetitions, it wouldn't be ""strictly decreasing"" and therefore we should return false, right?

Thanks!	If the instructions tell us to assume that certain inputs will not be passed into a function that we write, will we still be marked down if we don't add failwith cases to capture unexpected inputs (such as the ones we were told to assume would not be inputed)?

Thanks for all the help every week!	In my pattern match for the add_ancestor_labels function, when I return the new labeled tree, I am having trouble figuring out how to write the ""label"" portion for the node. I am calling guess_parent_helix left right, but left and right are leafs so they can't be inputted, and if I make them Leafs in the pattern match, then the match is incomplete and leads to a whole repetitive sequence of non-exhaustive cases. I know in the comments it suggests making a variable to handle this repetitive code, and the only variable I can think of that would be appropriate is a boolean to test if the node has two Leafs and then use if statements in my pattern match--is this on the right track? 	To create our own test case for the count_leaves function on problem 4 do we have to create our own trees? I created an ""all_apes"" tree in dna.ml including both lesser and greater apes trees however in dnaTest.ml, it does not recognize all_apes as a created variable and is forcing a compilation error ""unbound value all_apes"". How should I go about implementing my own test case for this problem?

Thanks!	Ugh that did the trick, thank you!	Yea, I got it! I used parentheses unnecessarily	Can we assume for problem 3 that once Met is found, all the following amino acids will be divisible by 3? (I.e. we won't get any singles or pairs of amino acids)

Thanks	Do the helices inputted into guess_parent_helix have to contain the same number of nucleotides?	Am I right in assuming that if we encounter the [A;T;T] or [A;C;T] triplets, we include the END marker in the list and if we get a [A;T;C], then we do not include the END marker?	I am getting the following error and I don't understand why. 

My logic is the following:
guess_parent_helix needs 2 helixes
helix_of_tree needs 1 labeled tree
right/left are both labeled trees. 

What am I missing in the logic?

Screen_Shot_20180916_at_23.02.38.png	For problem 3, if MET is found then can you have a few single nucleotides and then a triplet, and then a few nucleotides that don't form an acid and then triplets that will add to the amino acid chain? I.e [MET; triplet; A;C; triplet; triplet] .


If so, then if i am trying to return a boolean for a helper function that tells me if a three consecutive nucleotides is a triplet or not, what kind of expression would work such that if i run acid_of_triplet on three consecutive nucleotides that DON'T create an acid, then it returns false because in the given function acid_of_triplet, it claims to only return acids and no other type or failwith. I am very confused can i please have some guidance? In the below code, codio tells me that the wildcard will never get hit and that is because the function acid_of_triplet really has no other

Normally to form a labeled tree we require the helices to be the same length for each node. What should the fxn do if we give it helices of different lengths?	If you attend a lecture section other than the one you are registered for, do your poll everywhere answers still get counted towards your attendance? 	What exactly do we mean by depth 3? Are the examples we have in DNAtest depth 2 because there are like 2 ""circles"" (one being a node and the other being a leaf)? 
So would depth 3 have at most 2 nodes (2 circles for the nodes and 1 circle for the leaf)?	I accidentally used \ instead of / in one of my descriptive test names to say that 2/4 nucleotides match and once I submitted my homework I got the this warning: 
Warning 14: illegal backslash escape in string.
Will this warning go away if I resubmit with / instead of \ or are we not allowed to use any operators in strings?	For Question 8, it says that the function should be no more than 4 lines of code. Is this including the function stub that is given, or is this only including the lines that we write (my function is 5 lines counting the function heading, but should it be 4 lines including that line)?	is a helper function recommended for this? e.g. one that turns unlabeled trees into labeled trees? 

thanks!	ohhhh...it's the function itself that turns unlabeled trees into labeled trees...recursion...	I'm trying to construct a singleton labeled_tree leaf for my test cases but I keep getting this error even though Lleaf was defined in the constructor. 

This variant expression is expected to have type Dna.labeled_tree
The constructor Lleaf does not belong to type Dna.labeled_tree	Is there a specific style that we should follow for writing out trees? Sometimes it seems that it would make most sense to have everything on the same line (if there is not much code), but other times I need to split the tree up because of the 80 character limit. Should I just split the shorter trees too? Where should I split the lines?	What exactly should be the (output/values) of the labels we are adding to the tree?  For the one test case, it seems like the label generated is [A]  so should every inserted label be [A]?	I submitted my code and got a failure on number 3 (acids_of_helix) because my acids_of_helix returns an empty list [] when the END Codon occurs before the START Codon. Isn't that what it's suppose to do?	If counting_leaves and I pass a node with 2 empty leaves, should I return a 0 or a 2?	How many PollEverywheres can we miss? I left my phone at home today..	Wow, thanks again Jane! Might be a dumb question, but in type matching, I was wondering why Ocaml didn't make it possible to use types so for instance,

Leaf (helix) -&gt; 1 or
Node (tree * tree) -&gt; ... 

in pattern matching. Isn't this what it is essentially checking for? Why did the syntax make it such that it checks for variables instead of the types? I guess to make things easier so that people can use the specific variables in pattern matching? 	For Parent_Child_Hamming, should we use the NODE LABEL for the PARENT or should we just use “GUESS_PARENT_HELIX” to figure out what it should be?	Can someone explain what this means?

The guessed helix is computed using nucleotide-by-nucleotide comparison of x1 and x2: if the nucleotides match, the corresponding parent nucleotide is the same. If they don't match, the corresponding parent nucleotide is (arbitrarily) A.

This seems to be designated by A) that is cons'd on to a recursive call for guess_parent_helix() in the code. What is this actually doing as I'm not quite sure how to generate test cases?	Ok that makes sense, but what is so special about A? Does this come into play in later questions? Indeed I'm even wondering if it's accurate to say that if two species share identical helices than it's also true that their ancestors also had identical helices but I'm just musing randomly...delirious with fatigue	Hi,

I'm a bit unsure about the output of problem 8. If we have 4 helices, the output could be a balanced one or unbalanced one. (2: 2 vs. 1: 1: 2). Is there a ""correct"" one?

Thanks!	And thus I’d assume it’d also be zero for simplistic:LLeaf([C]) = 0andLLeaf([A]) = 0Correct? Thanks!	Are you referring to helix_of_tree()? But that function is for type tree not labeled_tree. Also aren't we extracting and comparing helices from left and right sub-trees, not nodes themselves? So I'm not sure how it's useful for add_ancestor_labels()	Would the proper way to indent this statement if it goes over the 80char limit be as follows?...

Is it something wrong with the format of the code or something wrong with the original file?	Looking over my code and I'm seeing that my hamming distance function is non-exhaustive because it does not account for the case where i might compare a non-empty helix to an empty one.

Since we were explicitly told not to test for different length helices, should I leave this as non-exhaustive? Or should I account for the case that Codio gives me and put it in my pattern match so that the annoying yellow warning dot goes away?

(* We will be automatically testing that your implementation of `equals` * makes use of the invariants to ensure efficiency. *)

1) If I use size, I am going through the whole list and I don't think this invariance is that useful or efficient.

2) Ascending order, I can't make it recursive so I don't know how to use this invariance to make it efficient?

I know we went over the delete function in class, but I am still a little confused. The method we discussed if the node to be deleted has two children is to promote the maximum of its left child.

	What is your last name?	Why doesn't the Cons (2, ) pointer point to z? why does it skip the stack and point directly to the Cons (1, ) on the heap?

	How do we conduct reference equality on options, and more generally how does the ASM deal with options?

For example, why does
Some 3 == Some 3 evaluate true, but 
Some {v = val} == Some {v=val} evaluates false	To clarify, in the first item, we are also creating two different int options correct? It's just the fact that they are immutable that == will return true?

And generalizing, does == return true on all immutable operands?
	I'm confused on the difference between the iter and partial_transform.  I know their input and output types are different, but conceptually I don't understand how they differ.  Can you clarify?	When I'm trying to implement the reverse function, I am trying to store one of the references as a temp but I don't think I am doing this right: 
let temp : 'a dqnode = x.prev inx.prev &lt;- x.next;x.next &lt;- temp
I feel like 'a dqnode is wrong, but I don't what I can change temp to in order for this to work.	Every time Some(r) is written, is it creating a new Some bubble on r, or if one exists already, will it just point to that?	I know that ints are kept on the stack, so are all instances of a given integer referentially equal? For example, 
     let a = 3
     let b = 3
is a == b?


So in my truncate tests, is it ok to use integers as my 'a type?	Can we use the ! and := operators for records as well?	But if we do have a record with just a single mutable filed such as in SimpleQueue, are we allowed to use the operators there or does the queue need to specifically be declared as reference for the operators to work?	So, any functions that check the head as an edge case should have nested pattern matching?	I just did with no success :(
n = {v = element, next = n.next}	How do we open that live terminal where we can test the output of single lines of code? We use it sometimes during lecture I believe	I saw this in the textbook notes, how does the following line makes sense: 

let () = print_string ""hello""

isn't () the actual value of a type unit? So would this not have to be 

let x : () = print_string ""hello""
	Which chapters are covered on the midterm?	There are FST and SND functions to use to return first or second elements. Is there ones to use for third and fourth etc or is this limited to first and second?	So shall I comment the tests for int_refs_aliased if I don't implement the int_refs_aliased function?	I just did that, rebuilt and cleaned and I'm having the same problem	Why is it that contains_alias_option r [o1] is true? What does adding ""Some"" to a ref do to it?	so 'a can be anything? then what is the purpose of differentiating btw. 'a and 'a bag why don't OCaml call all inputs 'a?	shall we assume that these two functions would not be called on empty queues?
Like if called it should failwith?	Why is it a bad idea to use refs_aliased in the contains_alias problem? What would go wrong?	For part 2 of 4B, why is the answer 'not useful'? Is it because the signature does not contain an empty and therefore it cannot produce something nontrivial? Is nontrivial an empty list in this case?

For part 3 of 4B, why is the answer 'not safe'? Is it because the add function is defined for an integer?	What's wrong with part i ?	i) Does every function in the sig need to be defined in the structure? What about vice versa?

iii) Why is the answer to this Not Safe, instead of Wrong (can't compile)? (int *'a) in the add function in the sig does not match the ('a) of the add function in the structure.

	Does truncate remove the element x, or only elements after that?

For example, if have q.data = [2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7], does calling truncate 4 q return [2; 3] or  [2; 3; 4]?	So I was thinking that when the item is found, it should update the next element to None (i.e. qt.next &lt;- None) and then we need to point the tail to this element, effectively ending the queue (i.e, q.tail &lt;- qt.next). Did I somehow not execute that through the way I wrote my code?	How do we do this again? Is it something like:let function1 (input1) : output = 
    function1 stuff
    let rec function2 (input2) : output2 = 
        function2 stuff
    return whatever is needed for function1

Or is it written differently?	Is there a way to access the next next node? n.next.next doesn't work because the types don't align, so is there a way so that it does?	Hi! To clarify, if I pattern match on q.next, does q.next point to an actual node or an option? 	I'm having a hard time implementing reverse in the last question. I'm pattern matching on n.next and n.prev and then am trying to manipulate the pointers to reverse the queue using commands such as n.prev &lt;- n.next and whatnot. Is this the incorrect approach?	Does referential equality only check if the pointers from two things in the stack point to the same object in the heap? If you want to see if two things in the heap which point to the same thing in the stack e.g. when say Some r == Some r, where r is already in the stack, does it simply see that you are constructing two different objects in the heap and say that they are not referentially equal?	Can we use the @ function in our construction of simpleQueue?
And more generally, can we use @ in exams?	This is a general question, but in OCaml are we able to have things in functions after the ""end"" statement in pattern matching? For instance, could we do ""begin match x with ... end"" and then after that, ""let loop () : unit = ..."", all in the same function?	I'd like to clarify the difference between the two ways of updating mutable records.

For example --
e1 := e2 ≡ (e1).contents &lt;- e2

Is it that := is used to update a reference, while &lt;- is used to update a dereferenced value? Is e2 a dereferenced value in both cases?

Thank you!	In my deque.ml, I am getting yellow dot warnings next to all of my function headers saying ""unused variable *function_name*."" Is it something to do with my let's and in's?	I double checked my contains and it's been passing all of the tests you wrote for it. 

Could your test possibly be causing an error because you have contains taking in one parameter when contains should take in two parameters? 

The constraints for contains is
contains (elt: 'a) (q: 'a queue)

but you have contains only taking in elt.	After submitting my first revision of the hw4, I looked at the first failure which appears to happen in my linkedqueue module. It's says ""First failure: length: given invalid queue"" which has me really confused considering we didn't have to implement this function for homework, and I didn't use the function beside the two standard test cases provided. Am I interpreting something wrong here? Also, I have a quite of few failures and errors later on throughout my project that I'm unsure are related to this one.	but Some Some Some 5 wouldn't fall under that criteria right?	Is None None an example?	hello, I'm trying to figure out stylistically what's the best way to call truncate. Currently I am doing ""let _ = truncate 2 q in "" but will I get points taken off for using truncate this way? Is there a better way to write it?	I'm working on from_list for SimpleQueue...
when initially making a record component within a function as the item that you are returning, how do you make it mutable? I tried {mutable data = l} but Codio underlines mutable in red and says that it's a syntax error after unclosed {, expecting 'LIDENT' .Is this because it is already assumed that the one element for simple queue is always mutable?	I'm having a lot of trouble writing the truncate function.  With lists, when an element didn't satisfy a condition but we wanted to preserve it, we could just cons it onto a recursive call.  Is there an analog of this or a similar strategy for queues?  If this is the wrong idea entirely, can you help point me in the right direction?	I am having a similar problem in my approach to truncate. Can you clarify what you mean by sequencing commands? Are you referring to the order of the if... else... statement?	Ah, to clarify I meant in linkedQueue.	If you create one dqnode (let's say with v = 1) whose next value points to another dqnode (say v = 2), and the prev value of the v = 2 dqnode has to point back to the v=1 dqnode, how do you initialize those together? Right now I have something like

let n1 = { v = 1; prev = None; next = Some n2 } in
let n2 = { v = 2; prev = Some n1; next = None } in
	Will our code compile if our implementation has extra functions than those in the signature? Conversely will our code compile if our implementation does not have a function mentioned in the signature?	I was wondering if there was a way to declare a placeholder 'a dqnode option. In one of the problems, I tried to instantiate it and set it to None but it said None was an unbound module.	We have operations like x:=y, !x, ref x, but are these shortcuts only for the 'a ref datatype? Or can I use them for any single mutable field data type?	For removing head, I want to check if I remove a singleton, the string will be empty. But when I write remove_head d, it returns a value. How do I make it return type unit so I can check is_empty next?	If i begin match q.tail with some n and I create a new node and set its prev value to Some n, will it reference the same value of the original some n or will it create another value in the heap. It should reference the same value right? 

	I am not using any if else statements. Should there still be brackets?	For these two functions, we are asked to update the deque in place. However we are given a value, not a dqnode. Does ""updating in place"" imply creation of a dqnode from that value and then correctly allocating pointers?	If I'm pattern matching (to access the nodes in the optional values) to do mutate stuff, is it okay for style to put a semi-colon after the ""end"" in the pattern match.
It gives an error if i don't but it also looks like it'd be bad style.	no i am iterating one at a time	Hi,

5 d on 18 spring midterm says the following is NOT a symrel:
       (1, 2)
       /
 (2, 1)

Is this just because the leaf (2, 1) is drawn to the left of the root (1, 2)? Should we follow this rule on the exam?  I was thinking how the layout is drawn should be considered arbitrary.

Thanks!	Right, I guess my question is whether or not we should assume that the way the tree is visually represented is in fact how it is structured, ie:

Q1: How do we know which node is the root and which is the leaf?

Q2: If the answer to Q1 is that one is drawn above the other on the page, how do we know the lower one is in the left branch and not the right branch (which would make is a symrel, correct?)?	NA	so would I have to manually reverse the function using pattern matching? 	Hello,

Thank you!!! 	I currently have my code like this, but it fails for the case where the first element of the queue needs to be removed. I think the problem is because the second else if statement in Some m, Some n is never used, instead the statement None, Some n -&gt; loop (Some n) (n.next) q is being used.

I'd really really appreciate the help. 

Anna	There are yellow and red lines in my kudos problem on Question 8. Not sure how to fix them	i'm struggling to figure out how to define a dqnode that needs to be inserted in a prior function: as in, if i define an n1 and n2 dqnode, n1 needs to be previous of n2 and n2 needs to be next of n1, but that can't be as their definitions depend on each other and there is no way to simultaneously define them. i tried to create them and then update one of their prev/next in place but then in my next line i'm seeing an error when i put them together ala what was done in deque_1 that my expression has type int deque and is not a function and cannot be used even though i thought the output was supposed to be int deque.

i'm guessing i'm approaching this wrong, and any pointers would be appreciated.	As the title suggests, my code is working with Integers, but not Strings. What am I doing wrong here?	How can I change the previous node's next pointer without doing pattern matching on 2 nodes like in delete for linkedQueue.

Hi, I am having a lot of trouble implementing the delete function in LinkedQueue. I feel like I'm just having a hard time wrapping my head around it and was wondering if y'all could take a look at my code and see which direction I need to go in. 

Thank you!	For cat_option, I see a recommended pattern matching case but I'm having trouble deciphering it:

(None::_::|Some_::_|[ ])

Are these two separate cases or is it one really long case?	In the comments above the valid method, it says ""Each of the functions below check the validity of their arguments * as an aid to debugging. In practice, doing such costly * validity checking ruins the performance of the queue operations, so * the checks would be removed once the code is debugged""

Does that mean we should remove the check for validity after we finish writing all the code?	Won't the to_list function for q8 be the same as already provided earlier in q6? (Except for l.reverse now just being l) or am I missing something.	 *    let rec assoc : (key: 'k) (l : ('k * 'v) list) : 'v =

Note that calling any native drawing method (such as Graphics.draw_rect) also requires conversion of the coordinates from our widget-local top-left-origin system to the bottom-left-origin system that the  Graphics library assumes.	How come I can't see anything? I'm currently on Task 3. Did I miss some essential code in task 1/2?

	Whoops, I didn't see the instructions for doing this in action and repaint. Do all the tasks in ""Updating Paint.paint_action"" and ""Updating Paint.repaint"" complete what is explained in ""Extending the Shape Type,"" not including making the constructor?	Isn't the notifier button parallel to the value_controller in this sense?	When I change paint_widget to use vlist there are large spaces in between my vertically arranged widgets. I'm not sure why since there are no spacer widgets in my list.	I've been changing the y part of the size for vpair but nothing changes when I open Paint, why is this? 	When I run my drag and drop code for Task 2, I get double lines for all the lines in paint.shapes while I'm previewing, but then it goes back to normal when I release the mouse. 
while drawing first linewhile drawing second line
after I am done drawing 2nd line	I have this problem too, and I'm not calling repaint inside my paint_action.	I'm also getting the double lines when previewing. I'm not calling repaint in paint_action either so I'm not sure what's wrong?	Why does my paint GUI look like this?
	Should we be utilizing the same draw_ellipse function in gctx in task 0 and task 4?	Would it be an acceptable solution to write a slightly modified ellipse function that takes in the arguments in a more clear way? For example, draw_box_ellipse that takes in two positions, corresponding to the bottom left and upper right corners?	Are we allowed to just copy and paste the code you gave us in the second match of MouseDown and paste into MouseUp? 	I am having trouble understanding the last line of instruction on Task 3 where it tells me to set the color in the graphics context. Can you elaborate on this?	I just finished Task 1, and i when I ran paint, in order to see if i implemented the functions correctly, nothing shows up. It is just a blank window..any suggestions?	For the last sentence of *Task 6 - Radio Buttons*, it says ""creating any arbitrary group of radio buttons to control any arbitrary value(s).""I don't quite understand how a radio button can control any arbitrary value. Shouldn't a radio button only represent a boolean value (true or false)?Please give an example on radio buttons controlling arbitrary types other than bool.	I did handle the negative cases - it crashes as soon as I move the cursor from the final position after dragging.	How do we access an encapsulated function that is in a record?  More specifically, the functions in make_control	Can somebody help me figure out where the problem is with my handle for vpair?

Thank you	Sorry to ask small questions again, but for ""changing the toolbars to use vlist and hlist"" after changing that in paint.ml is there something else i need to do? Because I'm still printing the same old line, rectangle, circle etc. 

Thank you	Is there a built in function to find the absolute value of an integer in OCaml? I tried searching for one but had trouble finding it. Thanks!	I'm having trouble adjusting the arguments in draw_ellipse to match the bounding box method. I'm confused because I would have expected ellipse to take in two positions, (1) the starting point (lower left) and (2) the ending point (upper right) but I see that it takes in a position at the center and the vertical and horizontal radii. Can you please offer some advice for thinking through this problem?

Also, should I be doing the math assuming (0,0) is in the upper left, as opposed to the bottom left?	Should we comment when we add code in tasks other than 6? As an example, when we add the Point button, should we comment (*A point widget*)?	Hi, I ran paint in my browser (Google Chrome) and it ran successfully in a pop-up window. However, when I click the quit button, nothing happens—I'm not sure if I accidentally messed up the code or if it has to do with an external factor. Is quit supposed to close the pop-up window?	When I run lightbulb, there is no pop up window. My pop up blocker is turned off and I'm using chrome. 	Still not working for me. It should function like the paint file, right? When you run lightbulb, it should display the lightbulb app web page, and then display another separate window for the actual lightbulb right?	When I run lightbulb, I just get two black boxes. Is this supposed to happen? I have finished checkbox and make_control.	If we choose to make the color sliders for task 6 (like the ones in the demo), should they respond to when a color_button is clicked (i.e, if someone clicks blue, should the blue slider go all the way up and the other two go all the way down), and if so, how can we go about implementing this?

When try to write this function, I get errors on the words I am using to hold variables in the state record (for example, if I use ""list"" or ""value"" to hold state, codio says they are unbound values.

It is said in the instruction that ""make sure you are only passing positive values to these functions"". Does this mean we need to check whether we are passing in positive values and make 0/negative values invalid?	I added the pointmode, but when I went to test it my draw line no longer works. It won't let me do anything in the canvas even though I didn't change any of the start and end line mode code. Any ideas of what could be broken?

Screen_Shot_20181018_at_2.15.06_PM.png

any tips?	What are we supposed to see if we've implemented Vpair correctly?	The comments before paint.ml's with_params functions say we should modify this function during task 5. However, the comments before repaint say we have to modify repaint in tasks 2, 3, 4 and maybe 6. 

Does this mean I cannot change the arguments of with_params, since I would have to update them in repaint? Or is this trivial and I can update arguments in repaint as needed?

Thanks!	Hello! I'm on task 1 changing toolbars section. My code compiled/passed the tests until the vlist and hlist, but my code for the last section returns an error.

I did not do particularly well on the midterm and was wondering if I could meet with you sometime one on one next week to discuss some strategies (particularly for the exams) as the semester continues. I cannot make it to your regularly scheduled office hours. 

Thank you,

Benjamin Zhang	Prof. Sheth,

I am available Mondays anytime before lecture starts, Thursdays from 1-3 pm, and Friday after 1 pm. 	What is supposed to happen at mouseDown? When there isn't any dragging yet? 	Are we meant to modify MouseDown or just implement the drag and drop through MouseUp?
	I an currently trying to add a change listener to the checkbox I created in paint.ml but I am not sure what the anonymous function should be conceptually. Is there an example I could base it off of? In lightbulb, it uses  (fun b -&gt; is_on.contents &lt;- b) and I am not really sure how that could help carry over. Thank you :)	In the colour toolbar, regardless of whether I put colour indicator at the beginning of the list or end of the list, it always appears before the first colour. I want to move it to a position after the last colour as shown in the instructions. Is there any way to do that?	So interestingly enough it is at the end on my screen. I cleaned, rebuilt, and still there was no change. But then, i reloaded my page, Codio asked me if I was fine with ""not saving"", which usually never happens, and after the page reloaded I saw that it had reverted back to the beginning of the list. Now, I changed it, rebuilt, cleaned, and rebuilt again, and now it works. Very weird. Thanks!	I had to put in a bunch of seemingly redundant lines of codes to prevent the compiler from thinking that I'm pattern matching. Not sure if its the best approach though	Since the materials covered after Midterm 1 will be a combination of OCaml and Java, does midterm 2 cover both languages or only Java?	Up to what chapters will midterm 2 cover?	Can I create a drop-down menu for choosing types of dotted lines? The only issue with this is that I need to extend the size of the browser window to fit the drop-down. Also, I have doubts about how I should deactivate other mouseclick listeners in the area that the drop-down covers.	So, a drop-down menu will just be a widget in widget.ml (using functions from gctx.ml). I can use it in paint to choose between different types of dotted lines. I don't think I will animate the drop-down, its repaint method will be based on a boolean value that tells whether the menu is open or not. Although I do see that this is very similar to a radio button apart from the fact that it saves space. I see the implementation as pretty challenging too as it might require two value controllers (one for which option in the menu is chosen and another for whether the menu is open or not) and I would also have to consider the situation when the drop-down is ""above"" some other features, so I'll attempt radio buttons and sliders first and then implement this if I have time. 	Oh it won't work until after I've implemented Point Drawing Mode?	When I toggle my check box on all that happens is changing the line width on the gui rather than the lines that are drawn, I was wondering what is occurring, Thank you.	When I run paint I get the canvas where it should be and then below it in the right corner of the screen I see ""Und"" and then the rest of my toolbars are cut off. 

Where should I be checking for an error? 

Thanks!	Currently, I'm calculating the center/radii from two positions (p and p1) with the ""fst"" and ""snd"" OCaml functions. I'm also using EllipseStartMode and EllipseEndMode

However, every time I enter paint and select the ellipse option and try to draw, everything (including all the buttons) disappears and I'm left with a blank canvas.

Could anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks	What's the difference between a change listener and an event listener? They seem pretty similar. 	Extending the shape Type
Recall that we are storing the ""history"" of the canvas in the shapes deque, where each item in the list represents some kind of basic drawing command. You need to make it so that ""drawing points"" is one of these possible commands.

what are these sets of instruction asking for? and where is this located? 	Do we need to change the color_toolbar and mode_toolbar code in paint.ml so as to use Widget.hlist?  Or can we complete task 1 reorganization by just changing the paint_widget to be vertical, without modifying how color_toolbar and mode_toolbar are implemented?

Thanks,	The original poster said that it was suggested to use this method elsewhere. Where/when was this suggestion made?	
Hello, I've been trying to debug why my code is not outputting the mode and color toolbar. I believe my code is right. I have tried changing
vlist [paint_canvas; mode_toolbar; color_toolbar]intovlist [mode_toolbar; color_toolbar]
and the mode and color toolbar shows up, but when I add paint canvas, the last 2 disappears. Perhaps the paint canvas is too big?	Handle can. Are we supposed to store the values and use them in repaint?	Do we have to comment any code that was given to us? And additionally, do we have to fix the indentation of any code that was given to us so that it is consistent?
	line and point mode both works fine. What's wrong with my code that causes such a crash?	Do we have to remove the old code for creating a line with two clicks since it cannot be used anymore?

    init = 1 &amp;&amp; vc.get_value () = 2)
I am a bit confused about how this test case works (in relation to the ASM). If init = vc.get_value(), wouldn't it point to vc.get_value() after vc.change_value 2 and thus resulting in init = 2? Why does it stay as init = 1? (I guess init is set to 1 in init = vc.get_value () as the right side is substituted by 1?) 	Awesome! Thank you for the response, could you explain a bit more about ""using a hidden state in the closure?"" I guess it means you need to call the function get value in order to get the value instead of looking at it and inherently getting the value right away? 	Hello,

I'm having trouble figuring out why my paint window gets drawn the way it does at the end of task 1.

It's my understanding that vlist should stack elements in the list on top of each other. So if i were to call vlist on [w1; w2; w3] it would draw (from bottom to top) w1 w2 w3. However, i got the opposite, i.e. (from bottom to top) w3 w2 w1. 

I can fix this visually by reversing the order of the list I input to paint_widget, but I'm not sure whether that's actually a fix or whether there's a bigger problem in vlist, list_layout, etc. Any indication as to where I might have gone wrong? 

Thank you! 	The instructions says that ""Add a PointMode constructor to the mode type."" for task 3. However, the mode instructions says that ""(* TODO: You will need to modify this type in Tasks 2, 4, and maybe 6. *)"".

The center should be (2.5, 2.5), but position is a int*int tuple. Should I implement another type of float position float * float for task 4?	I'm stuck on the implementation of List.iter where we're recommended to use it to implement draw_points. I know were supposed to be using the draw_point function, but the extra type gctx parameter makes it difficult. @1419 mentions (I think) using an anonymous function but I do not know how to set it up here and I'm not sure what that function would be doing. Can someone provide hints?	Even though shapes that I drew before clicking the checkbox thickens and not widgets outside the canvas, is the problem still with the gctx? I did create a with_thickness function that produces a new gctx with the thickness and incorporate that in set_graphics_state. 	I got my line thickening checkbox to work, but I'm still not sure why the borders around the widgets don't get thickened. Do they use a different gctx from the one that's made using with_params?	I implemented my line and point buttons but I don't see them when I run my code. What could I be missing? 	I added it to the mode_toolbar and that's in paint_widget. Is this same thing? 
	Can I create a slider that alters the size of the next point that will be drawn? If so, what's the best way to actually change point size, given that the Graphics library doesn't seem to explicitly offer the ability to change it?

Thanks!!	Could I draw a filled circle of different sizes instead (and call that a ""bigger"" point)? Also, when you say ""alters the size of ellipses and lines"" is that referring to thickness or something else? 	Yes, I think so.

I added the event listener but it's still not drawing ellipses	The instructions say that the logic is straightforwards but I still don't understand the explanation. So in order to implement the drag functionality what happens is that a mouse down event is detected. Then since paint.mode is LineStartMode it will store the first point as LineEndMode p. But the mouse hasn't been unclicked yet. How does paint_action know to transition from Mouse_Down to Mouse_Drag and Mouse_Up??

The instructions say ""In LineEndMode (x, y), the behavior in paint_action depends on whether or not the mouse button has been released"" but I don't see how that's the case.	I understand the issue, but I thought my implementation does not constrain the function to just unit values. I am confused where the function constrains the value.	change_value: this function actually does two things:

I have a checkbox that just has text, there is no smaller box such that the an ""X"" is marked or removed upon clicking. How do I fix this to add this functionality?	I'm getting the yellow warning line for MouseDown saying that my search is not exhaustive because I didn't pattern match over LineEndMode but I do not see why I should have to take care of that because it does not seem like a relevant situation- should I just insert ""LineEndMode -&gt; ()""?	All of my buttons and features work so far except MouseDrag when in PointMode. As of now, I am only able to draw individual points. The problem could be in how I'm handling MouseDrag,  MouseDown, or a combination of both but I'm not able to diagnose the problem.

I also notice that when in point mode, it takes two clicks for the point to actually disappear.

Help!	I am struggling to implement the change_value. I have read the other posts pertaining to this, and I am still struggling. I understand that we have to iterate through a list, and I feel like the code I have written should provide the expected result. However, I am getting a runtime error when I run my code indicating that the value of val make_control does not match. 	Can you clarify what changes to repaint I need to make? I'm very stuck.	I never decided to use (w, h/2) to check the bounds. In fact, my widget shows the same behavior even if I don't check where the event_pos is within the widget. 

I think it may have something to do with the way draw_rect works. draw_rect takes in a position, a width, and a height. The position ends up being the bottom left corner. Given that clicking up to one full height below the bottom edge of the rectangle leads to changing the state of that slider above, I'm guessing there is some disconnect between how the object is drawn and what the object is interpreting as being its space.	In order to keep my implementation of slider really simple (ie not having to convert between ints and floats), I made each of my sliders to be of width 255. However, with this implementation, my screen looks like this:

Is there any solution for this problem? What about ways to change the size of the app's launch window?

Reducing the y-dimension of the canvas fits it onto one window without scroll bars and keeps my app functional, but I'm worried there is an underlying issue.	I'm having this issue as well.  When the paint application opens on my screen, part of the lowest slider is off the screen and you have to scroll or enlarge the paint window to see it all.

When scrolling, the ""clickable area"" becomes mismatched with the sliders (and with all the widgets).  However, enlarging the window doesn't cause an issue.

Is this a problem that will result in a point deduction?

I get an unbound value error for flist, and I don't understand why. The example in the slides uses a very similar set up doing:

let mk_incr () : unit -&gt; int =
(* this ctr is private to the returned function *)
let ctr = { count = 0 } in
Where could this error be coming from?

Thanks	I've read all the piazza posts and they seem to deal with when all the previous lines change to thick or the lines don't change to thick at all, but in my case the lines that were thin still remain thin moving forward it's just that when I try and create new lines they are all thick regardless of whether the box is checked or not.

Thank you!!	I'm having a little trouble understanding the wording of this task. Could someone please explain?

You will need to make use of the ColorMap class to generate a map from Pixels of a certain color to the frequency with which identically-colored pixels appear in the image. Once you have generated your ColorMap, select your palette by retrieving the pixels whose color appears in the picture with the highest frequency	While implementing blur, I initially did it using the method defined in the docs, where a neighborhood around a single pixel is considered. However, I ran into a couple inconsistencies and wanted to know if an alternate implementation was OK.

1. If the initial neighborhood centers around (0, 0), the top and left edges have half-sized (or smaller) neighborhoods. I know this can't really be avoided, but is it ok to start with squares whose top left corners were within the bounds of the picture? I think it looks better if the bottom/right edges are the ones with smaller neighborhoods.

2. If the neighborhoods are defined by their center, there is a noticeable gap on the right/bottom edges at larger radii. The center is off the edge, but if the radius is 10 there could be 5 pixels on the edge where no blur is applied. Since the maximum radius is 19, the effect is noticeable.

My alternative solution was to define the neighborhoods by the top left corner, which makes it look less visually bizarre (point 1) and also fix the strip of unblurred pixels (point 2) since r+1 pixels are not needed to make a neighborhood. Is this ok?	Just to be sure, for the function AlphaBlend, the PixelPicture with the identifier ""pic"" is the first picture right?
I was a little bit confused by the part, because the second picture identifier is named ""f"".	When I run MyTest, the gray scale average test fails. That function came pre-coded; is this an example of the floats being imprecise, or is there something I need to do to change the function?	I'm a little confused as to what the int v input of the put function in ColorMap represents. Do you mind explaining this?	How much difference should we allow between the original image and the blurred image. I noticed the pic.difference was set to &lt;= 12 in the given test case. Should we follow this model?	I'm getting the failure below when I try to run the MyTest.java. testRotateCW should pass right off the bat, right?

 	Is the .equals overwritten though? I don't remember using the override keyword when I wrote the method.	For this function, the instructions state, "" Note that this method should not break encapsulation.""

What is meant by ""encapsulation""? Was this term discussed in lecture?	The classes are always shown in JUnit with red underlines and MyPixelTest.java is not recognizing Pixel.java. What can I do to solve this?
	Can we assume for rotation that the bitmap does not have ragged edges?	The return type of Gctx.event_pos e should be a position which is tuple of type int * int. Which is why I named the variable pos and why I thought I could extract the first value from it. I don't undestand why Gctx.event_pos e would be returning the function and not the actual tuple.	Can we use the weighted average function given to us in the alphablend function?	I didn't realize actually that int c[] was an input for Pixel but i'm confused about the properties of the array like what we're supposed to know about it- I would think that I'm supposed to input red, green, and blue values in but is it that we just have to deal with whatever array we're given and have to constrain them to the properties in the instructions? (null, empty, etc)	is there a way to find the index of the smallest number in an array?	so in counterclockwise would it be 
Red Black
Green Blue?	Is this class given to us, or are we supposed to make it from scratch, because I can't seem to find how to access it?

Thanks,	For the code that says ""// if an array has more than 3 entries..."", 
Would this work in ignoring the 4th, 5th, etc. values? Or is the problem slightly more complex Than that and requires a for loop?  Just want to make sure before I move on and finish the other functions and write the test. 
	Any idea why this is happening? Thanks. 	Haroni and Ally both tried to find my bug in border and invert. They said my code looked great and to post on piazza because they couldn't find the bug. I put my code into codio. My penn key is sharondo. Any help would be appreciated thank you!	I have the following fo reduce palette--it fails the test and when I run GUI it makes the image all one color. At first I was using the put function wrong but I think i've fixed that...

The error says ""invalid escape sequence""	Could the radius for blur be longer than the width or height of the bitmap?	To be clear, is it correct to say that we will not be given a radius that is longer than the width/height of the image?	In SimpleManipulations, the instructions say not to modify the input picture, but instead to return a new picture. I understand why we are doing this, but in 
grayScaleLuminosity (which was given to us), aren't you going against this requirement? Aren't you changing the Pixel values of the inputted bmp?	For pixel, if the data structure is immutable, does that mean that we necessarily need to use final fields for the colors? Or can it just be immutable in the way that an outside client doesn't have setters? Thanks.	I'm running the GUI and when I rotate the image (with the rotatecw code) it all turns to a bluish/navy color. Is there something wrong with my Pixel class?	
I am getting this error at the tops saying that JavaSE-1.8 is not compatible with specified execution environments.  I downloaded the 1.8 like the instructions said and I followed along but it won't let me run my MyPixelTest class because of this.  Any ideas on what I can do?	For the very first part of the task (declaring fields red blue and green) I am now wondering if they should be final as they should not be changed once declared. Or, if you use the final keyword, then do you have to initialize it when you declare it? Lastly, it wouldn’t be static because it’s specific to one object right? 	Gotcha! But for the future, when we declare a variable final, should we initialize it when we declare it? Or can we just declare it and initialize it later? I am confused about which strategy to take and the pro's and con's for it. 	I'm slightly confused on the parameters for border().

I've drawn a picture for reference. Does the picture accurately describe the information contained in the variable borderWidth?

Also what method have we defined that allows us to draw a pixel of a specific color?

	For a border of width two for example, would we lose information from the original photo if we began drawing the first pixel of the image at  position (2,2), or would it be best to begin drawing the image at position (3,3)?	I mean probably nested for loops like we've been using for other problems but I have a really hard time thinking about the boundaries for those for loops and how to integrate the error checking so I don't get ArrayOutofBounds exceptions	Hey so conceptually I understand why my code is throwing an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds error, and understand what you mean by initialize those that weren't initialized by the array to be zero. 

But I'm not sure how I would code a generic version of this. For example, if I have an array of length 1 and then an array of length 2, how would I write a single function that initializes green and blue to 0 in the first and blue to 0 in the second? 

	I'm getting the following ExceptionInInitializerError and MalformedURLException. How do I fix this? I just finished writing the code for rotate CCW and wanted to test it.
	Hi, I'm just wondering whether the screenshot indicates that I have imported the files correctly? I tried several times on importing on src but it all showed errors. Then I tried import on hw06 and it turned out ok. Just want to make sure everything is good before I get started. Thanks!	When I click on load new image for the GUI, it tells me to write down the path of where the image is located (either online or on comp). Is this supposed to happen? 	Not to my knowledge. The comps array (for pixel) is also private, so I don't know how one could alter any returned objects. What else could it possibly be? 	Hmm, I guess I don't see an immediate reason why it wouldn't. That was my attempt to demarcate a region where the image, rather than the border would be drawn.	can we assume that for the scaleColors method, only positive values will be passed in?	I don't understand why I cannot import files - and the ""Create module-info.java"" is not checked - in fact i didn't even find such box under the tab ""Sources"". How can I fix this? Thanks	Any ideas why average grayscale would have 306,255 differences? I ran it on codio and it looks super similar to the one provided. I'm not really sure where something could have gone wrong given I just added up the r,g,b values and divided by 3. 	Wait, so post strikethrough what's the suggestion?
Right now it's like Math.round((r+g+b)/3). 
What's a more accurate method?	Hello! I read the posts and the FAQ but couldn't fix my issue. My screenshot is the same as the one in FAQ, and I cleaned the project but :( didn't work. Could I get some help?
	Even rotate CW is failing in mytest. I am wondering what could be wrong here? I am working in Eclipse if that makes a difference. 	would we need to code a function to check if an array contains an element or is there already a function that does so	


Why is it that when I add the ""new"" keyword at the circled line, I get compile error? But when I remove ""new,"" everything works just fine? 	The directions state:

If alpha is 0.5, the weightedAverage is the same as the average     * of the two numbers. If alpha is 1.0, then x is     * returned. Likewise, if it is 0.0, than the result is y

Do we need to do anything other than this? The function had a return statement already written before implementation.	My current implementation of box_blur takes almost 20 seconds, so it must be very inefficient. I was wondering if there are any general steps I could take or advice I could follow to improve the efficiency of my function. 	Depending on how I change tgt [x][y] = src[___][___], I get : 
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 500 or 660 
or NullPointerException

Im not really understanding which part of my code is wrong? 	So the blurring of the  pixels will include already blurred pixels?	When I try to return a picture of a modified array, I use return PixelPicture (modifiedArray). (In AdvanceManipulations class) However, the compiler gives me an error that PixelPicture is not defined for the given class. Is there some other function that I am supposed to use?	Whenever I try to run a project, I am given an option of two Ant Builds, but I have no idea what they are, and when I click on one of it, I get an error message of: Build Failed; Reason: Unable to find an Ant file to run


Screen_Shot_20181029_at_11.24.55_AM.png	In the beginning?	Just to make sure, but the Bitmap will always be a rectangular 2D array right? Otherwise the photos won't make sense 	I'm trying to call scaleColors() from adjustContrast() in the file Advanced Manipulations in the following manner:

//Scale intensity  color value of pixel color component
        bmp = scaleColors(bmp, multiplier, multiplier, multiplier);
However I get an error that recommends I create a method call scaleColors() even though it's already been implemented in Simple Manipulations. Why can't I call it from here?	Shouldn't it be SimpleManipulaitons.scalreColors(...) since it's defined in Simple Manipulations? I also realized that after having changed it, that one of my parameters bmp doesnt work because it isn't of type PixelPicture. How can this be resolved?	I'm a little confused on the reduce pallete example that was given. Why is there so much black in the bottom right corner when the original picture was blue and there clearly is blue in your pallete? Like shouldn't the blue in the corner be closer to the blue elsewhere in the image than black?

For some reason, my version has a lot of red in it and I have no idea why/what I could be doing wrong considering the answer provided has literally no red. 	Hi!

I am not sure where I am going wrong with the border. I tried drawing out my code and it seemed to fulfill the conditions. I am stuck on where to begin debugging. 



	I know in the instructions it says that we should not be calling bitmap multiple times since it reduces efficiency but does calling things like bitmap.length() multiple times also affect efficiency?	could you tell me what this message means? I have trouble understanding this since expected and actual values are the same?	Hey I was just wondering if it would be considered more efficient or less efficient to create a third 2D array in task 5? My current solution simply modifies and returns the first 2D array since they're both the same size anyway. It also passes the test so I'm not sure if a third 2d array is necessary 

	If the code within the { } if statement is really really really short, can I just put it all into one line?

Or do I have to stack them all into separate lines?


	To follow up, grayScaleLuminosity is also coming up with a different value when obviously I have not made any alteration to the provided method. I tested the original Pixel thoroughly and there are no problems there, and the rest of the methods in SimpleManipulations work barring AlphaBlend and GrayScaleAverage.  For experimental purposes, I tried to delete the entire contents of SimpleManipulations and replace them with the provided SimpleManipulations (with many test cases missing and no work done on it) and grayScaleLuminosity still does not produce the expected 0.  Any ideas for what's messing up my program?	The int value is the number of colors that is in the palette, so how would that cause it to be shades of red not blue?	Hi y'all,
In my reduce palette function, I increment the using this set of nested loops :
for (int x = 0; x&lt;w; x++) {
    		for (int y = 0; y&lt;h; y++) {
    			Pixel p = oldM[x][y];
    			boolean exist = cmap.contains(p);
    			if (exist) {
    				int holder = cmap.getValue(p);
    				cmap.put(p,holder+1);
    			} else {cmap.put(p, 1);}
    		}
    	}
The issue that I'm having which I discovered over a long session with debugger is that the values are not being passed into the map propperly, and it ends up only recording the key and value for color, and incrementing only the value of that color. I have no idea why that is. What steps should I take to resolve this?
(cmap refers to a Color map that was created above the for loops).	I mean that the key value map only consists of a single key. The size would return 1 if called.

and when I put /Users/janna/OneDrive/Desktop/, I get errors in my tests, even the one that was provided. Am I writing it wrong???? Thanks!	is this the same as using this formula?

&lt;p&gt;c = sum(c of each pixel within radius R) / ((2R + 1) * (2R + 1))
	After I submitted my assignment, one of the errors I got was: First failure is blend_same: blend same image. I've been looking at this for a while, but I have no idea what is wrong. I added my own test where I alpha blended two same images italy.png, and it returned the same image italy.png, which should be correct right? I'm not sure what this error is trying to tell me and where I have it wrong.
	Thank you, but we changed that and my sum and tota_pixels are doubles?	Where do I find the picture to use in MyTest?	My logic is that I'm iterating through the pixels as normal, and each pixel I update min and minPix if the distance is smaller than what min was before. I set the corresponding pixels of my new bitmap to minPix. 

I can't make it to office hours until a bit later, I'm very sorry about posting so much code onto here! 	I was just at 120 OH, and Nick (the TA) looked at my code for AlphaBlendTest, which fails a ""First failure is blend_same: blend same image"" test upon code submission. It passes all tests given in MyTest, and after a good hard look, Nick couldn't find anything wrong with it either in the AlphaBlend method or in the Pixel class. He recommended that I ask on Piazza to see if another TA can perhaps check the backend of my submission to see what went wrong, given the extremely bizarre nature of the problem. An image of my method is attached below:
	Every time I try to run one of the rotations or one of the effects, I just get a black rectangle. It has the right dimensions, but even when I adjust the Pixel constructors to always return the same color (so for example I should just get a blue rectangle), I still get the black rectangle. I also tried transferring my code to Codio in case I had accidentally deleted something, but got the same result.  Any idea what I did wrong? 	Hi, I have reached the part where we use the distance function to check each pixel against those in our array of most common colors, but I am having trouble keeping track of the current minimum distance when looping through and checking distances. I was thinking about initializing something like a counter, but since we are finding the minimum, I don't know what to initialize that counter to...a little lost. any hints?	this is helpful! thanks. I'm unsure about that thought experiment. Wouldn't 1000 work since the maximum distance between pixels would never exceed it? 

	where in eclipse are we importing the images?	I think I have my blur method working correctly, except for the fact that in addition to blurring the image it also makes the image slightly darker. Might you be able to help me determine why this is happening?	What could be a potential source/reason of bugs if Blur results in a failure but small Blur does not?	IF our color map is as follows:

Color...Frequency
R...200
G...200
B...199
W...198

And we're interested in the top two colors to calculate the distance, would we be handling R, G, and B since R, G are the same frequency or just R and G?	I don't really understand how you can subtract the avg. color intensity from each color component of each pixel. wouldn't int avg be declared after int r,g,b and thus r,g,b can't have r-avg, g-avg, and b-avg?	i zipped my folder following the instructions on the hw assignment page, but when i click upload it takes forever to load and then exits the loading part. any ideas of what to do?	No, I was thinking that I was really lost with what path I was trying to do it, and that is why it was breaking. I wasn't sure if it breaking was a sign that I was really screwing it up.	My blur seems to be working fine except for the fact that it makes the entire picture red as well as blurring it. I have no idea why this might be happening. Any help would be appreciated. 	Could someone check mine as well please? I'm facing the same problem and not sure if I'm making the same mistake.	My contrast is failing all of the tests in submission, but I feel like my calculations are correct? Is there any insight you can provide? 
int avg = sum / (w * h * 3);
for (int r = 0; r &lt; w; r++) {
	for (int c = 0; c &lt; h; c++) {
		tPix = src[r][c];
		newR = (int) ((tPix.getRed() - avg) * multiplier + tPix.getRed());
		newG = (int) ((tPix.getGreen() - avg) * multiplier + tPix.getGreen());
		newB = (int) ((tPix.getBlue() - avg) * multiplier + tPix.getBlue());
		tgt[r][c] = new Pixel(newR, newG, newB);
	}
}
	I created a counter to count the number of surrounding pixels given the radius, and I divide the r, g, and b values by this counter outside of my for loops. I just can't figure out why I keep getting an ArithmeticException: / by zero. Please help! 	
In class on Tuesday, why is it necessary that the function values() return a copy of data and not data itself? I get that data must be encapsulated so that other people cannot modify data. But what kind of things could people do to mess up data if data is actually returned rather than a copy of data?	I just had a question regarding homework 6: I submitted my code last night and received a 20 point deduction due to an error in my blur function that I was unable to locate. I realized today that this was just due to me changing the original picture instead of creating a new picture (edited bmp instead of defining a target bitmap). Given that the mistake was relatively minor, as my function worked otherwise, I was wondering if there was some way to reduce this deduction.

I am a bit confused about what generally constitutes a ""big enough"" data structure to go in the heap. My intuition has so far been any mutable structure or anything that's not really a let binding or primitive value goes to the heap. However, I did want to formalize my understanding! For instance, in the 1::2::3::[] example, the cons(3, null) goes into the heap. Is this because it's a list data structure? 	
Looking at the last line of code in the answer key, it seems like this will return a red ticket numbered 1 first. however, the instructions say to start at 0. Is this a mistake?

In the first screenshot, since structural equality only consider the value within, so since p1 and p2 has the same value, although they are different objects, the two lists still are structurally equal, right?

In the second screenshot, since p1 and p2 refer to different objects, so the two lists are not referentially equal, right? Does this mean that, if we put L1 and L2 on ASM, they will be pointing to p1 and p2 in the Stack, instead of pointing to the same record in the Heap, right? I'm a little bit confused...

Thanks!

My apologies it was recitation 6 the first question; if this is the solution is the erroneous code available for review somewhere?	What does the console say?	By reactive programming in OCaml (it was in the topics we cover for the midterm) does it mean Chapter 18 (in the notes) and the GUI/Paint stuff we did? 	Just realized i forgot to add my question-how do you store the state of the stream's next element without actually changing the state of it-as if you were to call  s.produce and put that in a record wouldn't that be changing the value of the stream?	Why are function values never structurally equivalent to anything and only referentially equivalent to themselves? 	

Why does ctr2.reset() reset ctr1?	I had the same exact question. I think what the first person is trying to say is that the code as written would make it so that each instance of new_increasing refers back to the same counter. This is because the ctr identifier is located outside of new_increasing. 

The answer key relies on the assumption that instantiating s and t creates two separate counters, which I don't think is what the code really shows.	I was under the impression that we learned in class that strings can only be compared for equality using the .equals() method because strings are objects and not primitives. However, we have on of the recitation worksheets the following situation. 

String s = 'yes';

True or false? s == 'yes'

The solution says the answer is false. 

I'm confused as to why this compiles - can we compare strings using this boolean expression? I thought we needed to use .equals()	I am having a difficult time figuring this one out: Screen_Shot_20181106_at_6.26.52_PM.png	Aren't they? Both don't point to qn?	In this image, I have three questions:

1) in the last line, the 
    let _ = incr1()
    does that mean we want to create a new counter but we don't need to care about the value it returns?

2) The answer is 1 because incr2() creates a new counter other than incr1(), and incr2() is called once, so it's 0+1=1? Right?

3) If I want to count more than 1, then how to I do this? For example, we already called incr1() once, and now the value of the ctr within incr1() is 1, but how do I use these methods to increase 1 to 2? I couldn't call incr again because otherwise we would create a new counter. So how do I do that? 

Thanks!

	Also how would you draw it using the circles that represent some? Would there be 2 circles around cons?	I am confused as to why the stack of f is 0 and not 1.
If we re-write the fxn a b it is

and for the second for loop in iv why is it newData[0].length instead of newData.length?	If you were to use the in keyword though here it would still work right-as it creates a closure between all of the counters created using new_counter and the above declared mutable record which is referenced in the record created in new_counter?	
I was wondering why the answer wasn't 0; 0; 0; 1? 

Also ,can you explain what aliasing means?

Thank you	How are lists stored in the OCaml ASM? 

Example: x1 = [1; 2; 3]

In the OCaml GUI library, a change_listener is a first-class function stored in the hidden state of a value_controller widget. Every few milliseconds, the value controller invokes all of the stored change_listeners.

When interfaces are implementing/extending other interfaces, what key word do you use? 	I just wanted to clarify whether we would have to declare a ref type somewhere in our code if we plan to declare a variable with mutable contents.

Here we declare a ref type, and then create an x identifier that is of type ref. I just want to ask because in previous exams it seems that this step of creating a ref type has been completely ignored.	
Would this also be a correct implementation of the ticketMachine class using OCaml? I'm not sure if all the record references are allowed/wouldn't return an error.

let machine = {mutable myColor: string; mutable nextNumber: int} in

I was working on Q1 for the 2016 Fall Midterm and was a bit confused on something - 
Shouldn’t the answer be test (ii) because when you say head = Some qn and tail = some qn, aren’t you creating two new addresses on the heap? So why would they be referentially equal?

I'm implementing my channelMap.get(channelName).getJoinedUsers() returns a Set&lt;Integer&gt;. Shouldn't I be able to just tag on the .remove() to remove a specified ID? Any hints as to why this may not be working?	From what I've read online, it seems as though using the addAll() or clone() methods will simply create a list with new references to the same objects.  Thus, when you make changes to the ""copy"" you'll still be changing the private state which is not what we want to happen.  Can somone clarify this? I'm not sure if I'm just misunderstanding how it works	Where are errors supposed to be displayed in the client? For example, when I try to change someone's nickname to a name that is already in use, nothing happens in the client. But, the Eclipse console prints out 
Response sent to user 0: "":User0 ERROR 500""

What is the expected behavior?	How do I initialize a treemap field to start as empty before I have added any keys/values? I have looked at the java docs but am still unsure of how to proceed.	I've read through tasks 1 and 2 repeatedly and don't understand what I'm supposed to be implementing. #1 on the FAQ says ""understand the problem"" by reading through the materials. I've read everything and still don't understand. 

What does ""modeling the server state"" mean? What am I supposed to be initializing under ServerModel()?

Where are channels? They aren't listed anywhere in the code? Do I make them? Where would I make them? Do additional classes have to be in separate files or can I stick them in ServerModel()?      EDIT ---&gt; answered

There are so many instructions about design but nothing about concrete implementations of said design. Most of it boils down to ""choose collections that are convenient for things"". What things? How am I supposed to choose optimal collections if I don't know what I'm using the collections for?
 
Additionally Task 1 says ""Your job will be to implement the updateServerModel method for each concrete subclass of Command, allowing the server to process commands sent by its clients.""

Am I supposed to do that before moving on to Task 2? Or does that come after other steps?

These instructions are so unspecific.	Alright that's one question addressed that was mentioned nowhere in the instructions, thanks.	I'd still like some help actually understanding what we're supposed to do.	would we do this through returning Broadcast.okay in the LeaveCommand part of the class? 	I've looked at the java docs and all of the methods associated with TreeMap but it's not immediately apparent to me which of them is able to insert a key and value pairing.

	Follow up question: how do you remove a key from the TreeMap? I see that there's a remove value method but no remove key method? Is removing keys even necessary? It seems like it should be if we use the user ID number as the keys.	Hello!

I have two classes for my Wharton Industry Exploration Program on 11/16 and 12/7 (both mandatory) and it conflicts with both the 11am and 12pm lectures, so I won't be able to attend either. Would there be any way I could make up for the poll credits for those two lectures? (Maybe signing the course absence report?)

Let me know, thank you :)

I know that my current project structure is incorrect, and I now know based on other Piazza posts how it is meant to look. However, I am afraid of losing my current work if I move my files around, what is the best/safest way to do this?	When testing at the end of task 4, it says we have to ""launch an instance of the client. You can create as many instance of the client as you want by clicking on the menu option multiple times."" I'm not sure what this means and what menu option bar they are referring to.	Can we overload methods in Java such that they have the same name but take in different arguments?	could we add methods to ServerModel.java? If so, do we add them in the api as well?	The method registerUser() in ServerModel takes in a userID int that the instructions say is generated by the backend. I've read through ServerBackend and cannot find where this actual userID number is generated for use in ServerModel. Am I misinterpreting this and we have to write a method that generates a unique userID?	Which method generates the userID in server model? I couldn't find any method which did that.	I was looking over the schedule for the next few weeks and noticed that HW09 Game Checkpoint was due the Tuesday following Thanksgiving Break. I was wondering what work this involved over break and if there was a way to get a head start on it. 	So if i wanted to add and I use the add method, should i just store the return value in a variable and ignore it? Or is this not a good way of adding elements.	can you walk through the code step-by-step please?	In my broadcast class, I'm getting all the Commands being underlined saying that they cannot be resolved to a type. I'm not really sure what I should do about this...	I feel like it might be a problem with my file structure, but I have all the files, so I'm not really sure. I don't have the little box with the cross like in the picture on the FAQ, but I have all the files. I might have not imported them right though because I have duplicates. I'll attach a picture.

Screen_Shot_20181112_at_6.10.41_PM.png	if i'm trying to execute some code or another piece based on a server error should i be doing that inside of a switch statement? or is it ok to use a series of if statements in order to capture the right one?	When I submitted my project, this is the screen that I got. As you can see, it does not have any information about tests I may have passed or failed. Is there a reason that would have happened? Additionally, is there anyway for that to not count as one of my submissions seeing as I didn't actually get any helpful information? 	If we use the inbuilt eclipse function to create getters the function simply does this.

private someType something;public someType someGetMetod() {	return something;}
I had a few questions about this implementation
Is using this.something a better option or does it not matter?For Strings, this is fine, since Strings are immutable. But for ints/sets/lists and other mutable types show we first create a copy like this 
someType somecopy = something;return someCopy
or
someType someCopy = new someType(something);
? Or is this not necessary?
If we follow the default implementation of the getter is it possible that the state can be altered unintentionally? 	I think I'm having a similar problem but I get a question whenever I run the client server asking ""Enter the server's host name (localhost for this computer):"". When I input Bob I get java.net.UnknownHostException and nothing appears on the console. When I input like a number or User0 I get java.net.NoRouteToHostException so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be entering here?	What is the best way, such as date of lecture or chapter number etc to learn about java.util.Collections?	woops i only read up to task 2 LOL
I was trying to understand things before moving on; didn't know broadcast was explained later
thanks anyway	Are we supposed to do anything in task 1?	I am assuming it because it was given that way, but should the constructor for the server model class take in no parameters? 	more specifically, it's to implement the compareTo function and I'm having trouble thinking about the logic- would I just compare the key since I've defined it as an integer and value as a String? I'm not sure how I would compare it using @2790 if it's just a single map 	When I run my client, there is no way for me to send a message. All of the other buttons, like join channel, seem to working fine, but I can't actually send messages. Also, the message is incredibly small too. 	Can we at least duplicate users IDs?	This is a more general question, but what purpose do the values for enums serve (ex. ServerError.OKAY(200))? When should we be using ServerError.OKAY and when should we be using its value instead? Also, when should we be using ServerError.OKAY vs. just using OKAY?	Is the fastest way to change a value for a given key in a map to remove the key and put in a new mapping of the same key and the different value? Or is there another way to do it? (Tried the javadoc and couldn't find one, but I feel like there should be this feature as it is pretty common..?) 	Thank you for the response! I have a follow-up question: since a lot of the functionality is by specifying the name of the channel, it would be easier for the key to be the name as it is easier to find according to the key than the value (if I am correct, finding by the value will require iterating through the entire map). However, in this case, everytime I update the name of the channel, I would need to delete a mapping and add a new one. Is this efficient? Or am I missing a functionality of the TreeMap that is possible? 	If we are writing a method in this class, but want access to the values of the fields for the Command class (sender and senderId), will using this.getSender() and this.getSenderId() in a method body of NicknameCommand give those values?	Any help? I had to submit many extra files for the various commands, as for some reason, when i left say CreateCommand in Command.java, none of the tests would run. I would get an error saying ""CreateCommand is not visible"" and if I changed CreateCommand to a public class, it would ask for a separate file declaration.
	Holy crap nevermind I fixed (that) error. I changed the thing I'm passing in into a channel and then grabbed the name from that for the string compareTo.	But if this is actually LOCAL the testNickBroadcastsToChannelWhereMember should not pass, right?
	I'm having trouble figuring out how to implement getOwner in ServerModel.java

Using a map, I know I have to use a  .get(channelName) method to retrieve the channel, but I'm not sure how we figure out who the owner actually is? 

thanks	I have gotten my other commands for task 4 to work, but the nickname command test called testNickBroadcastsToChannelWhereMember has an error and it says that it throws a NoSuchElementException. I am not really sure what this means, and I don't know how to fix it. 

I would appreciate any explanation of what this means. Here is my update function for NicknameCommand--I know that the implementations for these can be really different so I get it if you can't offer any advice on this, but I can also answer any questions about my implementation if that might help.

	DOUBLE BLESS	    private Set&lt;Integer&gt; channelUsers;     public void dltUserFromChannel (int userID) {
        channelUsers.remove(userID); 
    }
Hello! I was just wondering: the integer userID I pass in is a primitive value of integer, and the set channelUsers is a set of the Object Integers. When I remove the primitive integer version userID, it still typechecks. Does it however, do what I want it to? or should I pass in Integer userID? I am not quite sure about the distinction between the object version and the primitive version of integer (if there is one other than the static type). 	Above is commented-out code that contains code which, if run on eclipse, yields a light yellow line and the eclipse gets mad at me and says something like ""The static method ""isValidName"" should be accessed from the model in a static way"" and makes me change it to ""ServerModel"" instead of just model...

is this the right fix?

	I am having trouble finding the menu option referred to in the instructions that opens multiple instances of the client. I have tried redouble-clicking the jar file, and that hasn't worked. The FAQ gave me the same advice. Where can I find this menu the instructions refer to?	I feel like the change nickname method should be in the ServerModel class, but if it was made public so that NicknameCommand had access to it, wouldn't anyone have access to changing random people's username?	Say userA is the owner of channel1 that contains userA, userB, userC.

userA is also the owner of channel2 that contains userA, userX, userY. 

When we deregister userA, should the recipient of the broadcast instance be userB, userC, userX, userY? 
	Is there a way to make sure code in Eclipse is properly indented, so we don't have to do it manually?	I made a new class to handle all my channel related tasks. How do I make it iterable after implementing the iterable interface? I remember we went over this in lecture but I am still a bit confused.	What goes in the ServerModel constructor? Since the ServerModel class has no fields, what exactly are we initializing? Can we create fields that are the collections that we want to use to store the information in the server state?

I'm pretty sure I submitted an updated file in which I fixed at least some bug, but I'm getting the exact same receipt as what I got when I first submitted, even the attempts remained the same (like I still have 2 remaining attempts, which should be 1). Should I try submitting again? Would that mean that's my last attempt?	So when I have a person deregister as the owner of two channels, and I run the test, I get that error. I looked at what it is, but I don't know how to identify where this is occurring.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated!!	Ok I see this, but why is this actually an issue. I guess it would be if I removed something and then tried to access it?
Otherwise I don't see how I could fix this. Should I make separate for loops?	I've created class data type for ""a user"" and I've also created a collection ""ClientSet"" that extends TreeSet to contain users.

I was wondering about testing server model queries (things that are associated with Task 2). Essentially, the functions that we create are useful in testing other things in later tasks, but in order to test the server model queries, it is dependent on whether we implement the other methods well (i.e testing one is dependent on the other working, so i don't really know how to test). 

How do we ensure that the model queries work? 	I realized that I screenshotted and attached the wrong failure! I have not implemented CommandLeave yet so that will obviously return null. I meant to attach the testCreateNewChannel failure (which I have fixed above).

	In tasks 3,4, and 5, are we only supposed to handle ServerErrors provided to us or do we need to handle others as well? For example, what about No_Such_User errors in the MessageCommand?	Since they are immutable, referencing them directly shouldn't cause any encapsulation issues, right?	It was working perfectly fine on eclipse, but it won't let me submit.	Gotcha! So if we are dealing with primitive types (getters for primitive types) we would just be able to return the field's name because it would return a value.

Now that the second midterm has come out, I think it's probably more clear what my grade will be. I scored very poorly on the first midterm, did better (but was still considerably below average) on the second midterm. I was wondering if it is possible for you to give me a ballpark estimate of where grades will lie for this course given a raw score.

I'm having a hard time figuring out where these extra words came from?	I think I was confused what the input was. Is the input like a Buffered Reader or any other reader ? And calling .read will give an int ? 	I understand that you can't release the details of submission tests, but an efficient layout for the argument file sounds like there are multiple misspellings and corrections on a line. Because the BufferedReader reads a line at a time, should we worry about there being some separating character between each pair besides a new line, or is that not the case?	/**this piece of my code is not compiling, and it says I need to either add catch blocks or add signature ""throws"" to handle IOException but I am not intended to include IOException in this test case? **/@Testpublic void testEmpty(){    Reader in = new StringReader("""");    try {        TokenScanner d = new TokenScanner(in);        assertEquals(-1, in.read());    } finally {        in.close();    }}	Can we add our own private methods (just to reuse code) in TokenScanner?	If i have an input string like ""Hello!!!"", would hasNext return false the second time because it bundles both exclamation points together and realizes there is no token after that?

I am having a lot of trouble handling escape sequences in the next method of my TokenScanner class. I currently loop through the characters in the input stream until the isWordCharacter method of the current element is different than the isWordCharacter method of the next element/or there is no next element. This doesn't work for escape sequences because they are a combination of word and nonword characters.

Is there a better approach to handling these newline elements?	in lecture 11/12/18 and 11/14/18, iter.next() and fin.read() were brought up, respectively. can someone clarify how it deals with the beginning of the iteration? from my understanding, when called, it iterates through keeping in mind what was just returned. so in the first call, since nothing was returned before, it returns the first element. but then on the second call it gives the second element and so on. i'm confused as to when it's value becomes the ""next element"" in that we can use fin.read() to check if the next element in the sequence is -1, that is fin.read() returns -1 to signify the next element instead of the one we are currently on like it did during the first few calls? can someone go through an example in depth? 	lecture 29- slide 18, lecture 31- slide 10 	Hi, I'm using BufferedReader.readLine() to read through the lines in my file (which have blank lines in between).

	For this test case: assertTrue(TokenScanner.isWordCharacter('\''));

Does this mean that /' represents an apostrophe? Or is it a slash and then an apostrophe?	I don't understand why we're creating a token scanner class.

        try {
            assertTrue(""has next"", d.hasNext());
            assertEquals("" "", d.next());           
            assertFalse(""reached end of stream"", d.hasNext());
        } finally {
            in.close();
        }
    }
Basically I just want to test if it returns a space.

But what actually happens is my next method gets caught in a while loop reading a question mark ""?"".
However, within my while loop if I put a break statement to prevent the loop, it correctly returns the space character. What might be causing this? The relevant portion of my next method is below.

//return non word characters
    	else //if currentLetter is not the start of the word
    	{
    		//add it to the String and return it
    		while (!isWordCharacter(currentLetter))
    		{   			
    			tokenOut += (char)currentLetter;
    			System.out.println(""running"");
    			System.out.println((char)currentLetter);
    			readNextCharacter(); //update currentLetter
    			//break;
    		}
    		System.out.println(""END"");
    		return tokenOut;
    	}
If I don't comment out the break statement the console infinitely prints
running
?
running
?                   --&gt; for infinity, and never gets to ""end""
	I don't see how that's relevant....

I'm not passing in an empty string, I'm passing in a space character as the string. Moreover it's the only character in the string
and my function interprets that space character correctly if it only loops once, but when it loops infinitely (for reasons still unknown to me) it interprets the space as a question mark.	When testing TokenScanner in myTests, is it okay to use a StringReader as the reader to pass into the tokenScanner?	How should I test the behavior of tokenscanner if the input reader is empty? is this a valid way? 

assertFalse(TokenScanner.isWordCharacter('')); 
	For dictionaries which are created using tokenScanner it is impossible for words to have trailing or leading whitespaces, right? Because the entire point of TokenScanner is to create WordString and NonWordString(Strings with spaces among other things) and only word strings are added to the dictionary. Do we still have to worry about whitespaces?

	Hello, 
I understand we aren't allowed to post private messages or upload codes but I was actually suggested by the TA's to put a private post as they aren't also sure what's wrong with my code.

So this is the error :- 



This is my code for isWordCharacter and isWord


I have just changed the part in isWordCharacter where I casted it to a Char, but I thought my previous code should have worked too as under the hood both are stored as int.

I have also passed all my tests and I think it is pretty exhaustive.	Eclipse! Could it just be that my laptop is slow?	Is it fine to use the TokenScanner.isWord method in getCorrections() though, because otherwise we would be repeating code to check Character.isLetter() and for apostrophes?	Is the lecture on this up coming Wednesday going to be recorded so it can be viewed at a later time.
	I submitted my HW and lost two points because my Gettysburg test was over 500 ms. Do you see any way to make this more efficient? (I asked a TA during office hours, and she told me to make a private Piazza post so here I am lol)	So far, this is my code for dictionary.

Above this code, I've already made a private field 
    private TreeSet &lt;String&gt; dictionary;
that is a TreeSet of Strings.

Questions:
1. How do we get the code to feed each ""token"" that the token scanner produces into the Dictionary? 
2. When we store each token into the TreeSet, how can we check if it is duplicate? [oh! we use the .contains( ) thingy, right?]
3. Also, are there any private fields that I'm missing, or elements in Dictionary that don't look quite right? If I'm missing anything you don't have to explicitly tell me if that would be too revealing; a nudge in the right direction would be so appreciated.

Warmly,
Anders.
	Do we need to use bufferreader for this or tokenreader?	It takes a dictionary...
Should we only make the operations on ""getCorrections""?	Since the fileFormatException is defined as:
public FileCorrector.FormatException(java.lang.String msg)

When throwing it, should the msg include the entire line where the formatting issue arises?

For example: if the issue arises for a line: ""wrong,correct,"" should the input of formatException include the entire line?

If yes, is it okay if the inputted string is trimmed or should the input string be exactly as the line taken in from the document?	I see in the comment in FireCorrector.java ""Instead of using the TokenScanner to parse this input, you should read the input line by line using a BufferedReader.""
However, in the constructor of FireCorrector, we only know that the parameter that we take in is of type reader. I am a bit confused how I should be able to use BufferedReader.	So I'm trying to implement my next() function, but when I try to print the output to the terminal I get: A

d

I know that the statement return buf.toString(); in the while(isWordCharacter(c)) is wrong, but the thing is when I take it out the code ignored ""aren't"" and assumes next is "" "". Can someone please give me a hint as to what I can fix to make this work? Or is my code just wrong and getting lucky with the println statements? Thanks so much!	Can I use an arraylist for HW8?

This makes the implementation of the rest of the Dictionary class much easier, but does not directly put the contents of the file into the ArrayList. Is this okay?	This is true, I'll switch that, however is the manipulation okay?	Hi, I wanted to make sure i'm properly understanding how FileCorrector is supposed to behave so i can write my test cases properly. 

1. What happens if we try to get a correction for a word that's not in the file? Do we return an empty set?

2. Can someone clarify what the instruction below means specifically (i.e. if having mixed case should impact the correction that gets outputted or not)? 

The lines are not case-sensitive, so all of the following lines should function equivalently: 
 baloon,balloon
 Baloon,balloon
 Baloon,Balloon
 BALOON,balloon
 bAlOon,BALLOON	Is there any way we can create an input for a Reader that will cause an IOException when we try to construct the TokenScanner? I'm not sure what exactly might cause an error.	For FileCorrector, what counts as an invalid format on the left/right sides of the comma?

For example, say we have one,two

and ""one"" and ""two"" are all trimmed.
Is:
one = 123cat
one = hello-cat
one = funnything---:!

Are the above all valid formats? or do the left and right side need to be words as defined in TokenScanner aside from allowing spaces in the middle?	Do we need to add any code to this? As it stands, I do not see where the two get exceptions get thrown, if not. 	Hmm, so if I am understanding correctly, is this because the constructor for TokenScanner throws an IOException so I need to deal with that explicitly in my code? I am a bit confused as to why putting ""throws IOException"" solves the problem. 	just making sure! 

say our correction text file has lines: 
katlyn, kaitlyn

if we search up KatLYn as the key, should we match the wrong token to the kaitlyn (and return Kaitlyn as the correction set)? 	I was just trying to make the searching process faster by categorizing all words by alphabetical order with a TreeMap. I guess I don’t have to do this to speed up the searching?	Also, is there any ways to test if TokenScanner throws an IOException when it is supposed to? I am already testing for when it appropriately throws an IllegalArgumentException. I know that's a type of IOException, but is there anything else I should be testing for that?	In FileCorrector can we use StringTokenizer?	I can't tell why my code is throwing a NullPointerException for each test in Dictionary. I check to see if the TockenScanner is null but still it returns a NullPointerException for the DictionaryTests.	Then, would it be throw a NullPointerException, after being caught be a NullPointerException?	Hi!

I need to fly internationally for winter break and I purchased a ticket months ago to board on my flight at 7pm on 12/20. I know that the final exam is scheduled on that day from 6-8pm.

Are her's and hers' considered one swap apart?	Hi TA's!

1) Should I be reading the whole file at the start to determine if the file contains at least one line of invalid format? Or read it incrementally and only throw a formatException when we get to an invalid line? 

2) I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to code whether or not a stored line from BufferReader contains invalid format. I'm trying to use the split method on the String (see code below) but am confused as to how it works (I've read the Javadoc but it contains a lot of language that we haven't learned yet).

I don't know how I can proceed without falling prey to IndexOutOfBoundExceptions, since the line of code can contain so many different combinations of words/non-words/commas/non-commas. What's perhaps a simpler way for me to go about addressing the invalid cases of:

     * ,correct&lt;br&gt;
     * wrong,&lt;br&gt;
     * wrong correct&lt;br&gt;
     * wrong,correct,&lt;br&gt;

For 2-player games (such as ConnectFour or Tic Tac Toe (i know its off limits but as an example)), can our game be single player and have the computer randomly make every other move (as opposed to implementing upper-level AI)?

	Hello, for my HW 9 project, I was considering implementing the game Battleship. The player would lay down their ships on a grid while the computer randomly places its own ships on its own grid. I would write it so that the computer does not simply randomly fire at the player's grid, but rather make educated guesses based on if it has scored a hit on the player's grid or not (as a human normally would do). Would this count as complex game logic? If not, I'm having some trouble coming up with other core concepts to include within my game (I know I would definitely use a 2-D array). Thank you!

	I wanted to do Super Mario for my game, but I am worried that one aspect of the game may be too complex to implement within two weeks. I wanted to figure out how the screen moves with the character. When you play Super Mario Bros, the whole world isn't seen initially, but when Mario moves the screen moves with him allowing the player to see more of the world. I have been thinking about how to implement this and I am worried that may be too complex. Should I make another game or is there a simple way to implement this design concept?	Oh I see. The only issue I am worried about with that approach is how can I manipulate the images when the object of Mario is over the image.

For example, I would like the [0][0] to be drawn and then [0][1] to be drawn 2 seconds later. 	 I'm placing this within an individual function that I call in another class, but it is pausing the entire program. Do I need to have multiple threads? If so, how do I do this?	Are we limited to the data structures we were taught in class or can we use others (i.e. Hash tables, tries)?	I was thinking about creating a game where you are driving a boat down a river looking at the boat from the top and it is a scrolling game. You move the boat right or left using the keyboard (or possibly might create a wheel and using the mouse to control the boat that way so it is smoother, but that might be too hard). 

Levels consist of a snaking river that you have to navigate through, and avoid obstacles in the way and also pickup coins along the way. I will use I/O to save the level that a certain username last completed in a document and the number of coins that person had, so every time you re-login you do not have to restart from the start of the game. As you collect coins, you can also purchase new boat colors, new perks like a gun to shoot down obstacles, stronger bullets, and things like that. Also, after every level you complete, you have the opportunity to wager a certain amount of coins in order to win a multiplier of that amount, so you can win coins or actually lose coins, but will make the likelihood greater that you win coins, but it will be implemented with a weighted randomness.

As the levels get higher, the scroll is faster, and the obstacles get more difficult to shoot down with lower bullets. Also may implement some one-time usage perks like a slow down so that the scroll is slower for a set amount of time.

Since it is a scrolling game, I will use a 2D array to map the board and will use collections to store object placement as the scroll happens. Collections will also be used in order to create a shooting mechanism to shoot down objects. 

My fourth component will be Testable Components testing valid game states. There are states that I need to test such as testing what happens to the boat when it collides with the shore or with an object in the river, what happens when the bottom of the screen catches up to the boat or is “pushing” the boat forward, dealing with bullets knocking down obstacles, dealing with different levels of obstacles, dealing with a user leaving and then coming back with the same username to same coins and same levels, the ability for a player to restart from level 1.

Any feedback or tips for what else I need to develop would be very helpful/ feedback in terms of if this is far too difficult! I want to push myself to make a new game from scratch, but also don't want to make a bad game as a result, so feedback in that regards would be helpful as well. Also made it private because I did not know if sharing game ideas is allowed. Thanks!	OK thanks for the response!

Would these work as implementations of dynamic dispatch?

Dynamic dispatch should change how the gun shoots, like how many bullets at once, should also change the color of the bullets, the type of bullet, the gun sprite on the boat, the damage bullets do to an obstacle

Boat should also be dynamic dispatch, the better the boat the more refined your movements should be or more sensitive they can be, need to be able to store the type of boat it is and what traits it has, maybe also a better boat should be able to move forward and backward as well as right to left, or have faster movements.

Once I make my JFrame, what's the best way to 1) go about drawing each slot in the array as a box until eventually an 8x8 grid is drawn (how do I hardcode where the graphics_context should be?) and 2) make each of those slots ""clickable.""

I've looked at the sample code but most of it does not seem to apply given that it's a game that involves ""animation"" with time steps. I know that for question2 I need event_listeners but am still very confused.

Thanks! 	Hello! I was just wondering if any TA would be able to briefly go over my design doc and see if it is too ambitious or even feasible - thanks so much!

I am currently a TA for CIS 110 and am interested in applying for the CIS 120 TA position as well. However, I was hoping to apply for the CIS 120 TA position and apply (or tell them that I am coming back) for 110 as well so that in case I don't get the 120 TA position, I still have somewhere to return to.

Common Mistakes

Creating subtypes just for color, size, speed, point value, or up/down/left/right/straightforward movement does not count


	Today in class, Professor Sheth mentioned that we can get some pre-feedback for a game idea to ensure that we can be waved off a blatantly wrong path. So this is my current game idea:

A crossword solving game. The concepts used are
2-D Array - models game state i.e. the main crosswordCollections - Stores users actions so that users can undo and redo movesI/O - Game can be saved and resumed from where it was last left off. Also the crossword questions(and answers) are saved in a text file and read off every time the game is started. Multiple crosswords of different genres are includedTestable Component - Correct and wrong answers along with edge cases can easily be tested on the 2-D array.Advanced Component-High scores, along with accuracy, and time takenWill have two modes. Hard mode and easy mode. In easy mode if you submit wrong/incomplete crossword, wrong/blank answers are highlighted. If you get most of a word right, the correct word is provided. You can then correct/add new answers and resubmit. Your total time will go on the ""high scores board"". If in hard mode you submit incomplete/wrong answers you have to start again from scratch

From a cursory glance, does this game seem like a good fit for this homework?	Would creating a sudoku solver be considered AI/ another advanced topic?
Or if I use a backtracking technique can i count it as recursion?	Would appreciate a quick lookover of my proposal to make sure my overall design makes sense and that my explanations are thorough enough! Any feedback would be much appreciated. HW9_Game_Proposal.pdf	For my project idea I want to make a 2d space fighter game.

-2d arrays: The board will be modelled to a 2d array as It is a grid. These arrays contain all possible locations that will be associated with the click from a player.
-Collections: The moves will be contained within a set, since each move can only be made once by each player.
-Inheritance: The boats will all extend the same class. They interact the same with moves but have different shapes. The moves will also extend the same class. A “white” move works differently from a “red” one since the hits have more implications for the game. Furthermore the “red” moves will be associated to a boat, whereas “white” moves (misses) will not be associated to boats.
-Testable Component: A boat being hit. Legal vs illegal moves. A person winning etc. All these game interactions should be tested using Junit.
-Recursion: Not 100% sure about this one. Might use recursion to draw the board.
-Advanced topic: Might implement a simple AI wherein, if the cpu hits a boat, it will try to hit the spots immediately around it in order to eliminate that boat as fast as possible.	Hi Jane, 

We talked yesterday at office hours about my project, Swap: The Adventures of 'a, where I have different ints bools and strings falling down that 'a has to catch. 

I'm implementing the 2d Array which represents the Gameboard and I'm having a little bit of confusion separating out the logic from the drawing aspect. I have a class SwapBoard where I want to implement the logic, and then implement the actual drawing of the board in a separate class BoardDraw - I know I have to have some notion of a nested for-loop here, but I keep feeling like anything i do here (instructing the array when to hold certain objects) is something I'd just do in the draw part. I want my TickA object always to be in the bottom row, and the other objects falling from the columns at random. Am I missing something? I want certain objects to be in the array and be falling down automatically, just kind of confused about how to proceed. Any suggestions? 

 	Thanks so much! Would “setting the scene” fall under logic or drawing? I think that distinction is where I’m getting most confused, bc it seems nothing happens until I draw the graphics 	On our game proposal, if we have more than 4 core concepts filled out, is this OK? Could we get feedback for all the ones we have written down and how does the game proposal get graded as a result?	How thoroughly should I be describing the game that I'm making? I want the TA to understand what the game is, but going into too much detail will have me writing so much that my text won't fit in the allocated space.	Under Advanced Topics, ""Collisions (beyond simple bounding boxes or circles)"" is listed as one of the options. I wanted a little clarification on what this meant. Does any collision that accounts for shapes other than rectangles or circles count? In other words, if our objects that are colliding are more complex than rectangles / circles and we account for that in the collision, does that count as an advanced topic? Or are you looking for something else? 	I am thinking about making an AI for my game so that it has single-player and two-player functionality. Does making an AI count as one of the four core concepts that we need to implement in the game?	Since there are 4 ghosts in Pacman, I'm thinking about implementing max-min algorithm for one of the ghosts. Could you approve this?	I'm thinking of doing 2048 and I'm having trouble coming up with a fourth category. So far I have 2D arrays, File I/O, and a testable component. 

If I added recursion is it sufficient to say that I'm using a recursive algorithm for finding the tile of maximum value after the player loses the game? Or does recursion need to be something more complex?

Do you have any other suggestions for a fourth category I could add? 

Thank you!	I want to make Connect 4 game only single player such that the player plays against the computer, and the computer would have an AI component to strategically place its next coin. Would this count as an AI component?	I was thinking to do something recursive where the computer checks recursively how the opposition's coins are positioned and then placing its own coin such that it blocks the opponent from winning.	I'm thinking of doing Scrabble for the final project. Would it require me to build an AI/Computer player or would 1 v 1 player functionality be sufficient enough? If I did do a computer player, how would I go about doing this/how complex would it have to be? Open to suggestions!	Some people may have heard of the card game Egyptian Ratscrew, which I'm designing for this project. It is a multiplayer game, and it has very complex game logic, to say the least. The goal of the game is to accumulate an entire deck of cards, and you can take the current pile of cards by slapping it (or clicking a ""slap"" button for my computerized version). You are only eligible to slap under any of a variety of circumstances pertaining to the previously played cards (ex. if the prior 2 cards were the same, if the prior 2 cards add up to 10, if the 1st and 3rd most recently played cards were the same, etc). An ineligible slap results in the loss of a card from that player. Since this game is inherently complicated, can I count it for the Complex Game Logic Concept?	As mentioned in Google Doc, subtyping is used in Minesweeper, but I can't see where it is used. Can you please explain where subtyping is used in that game? Thanks a lot!	I plan on creating the traditional game of Checkers. I have an abstract class called Pieces with subclasses of Checker and King. A checker piece can become a king when the piece reaches the end of the board. A king can move both forward and backward diagonally whereas a normal checker piece can only move forward diagonally. Is this complicated enough / can this satisfy the Inheritance/Subtyping for Dynamic Dispatch concept?	For instance if I want to implement Asteroids, is the ship collision with asteroids / ufos considered simple because it would use hitboxes / that sort of collision?	Hi, I am thinking I'd like to do a variant of the classic Pong game in which there are other objects that ""randomly"" float through the screen and block the ball.

If these random floaty things had different shapes (and perhaps speeds, trajectories, etc), would this qualify for the inheritance concept?  I'm thinking it they all may be different children, as well as the platform and ball themselves.

Additionally, would a collision with a oddly shaped (eg, not perpendicular to the balls motion) object in which the ball models a realistic deflection count as an advanced topic/one of the four concepts?

Thanks!	what are the key differences in using an abstract class vs an interface?	I'm planning on coding a minesweeper game, and I was planning on creating two types of squares (bombs or safe) which inherit from a larger class. This would be necessary because, for example, revealing a bomb and revealing a safe square might have different consequences. Would this be an appropriate use of inheritance in the project, or do I need something more to satisfy this requirement?	So if I had some different functions for the bomb and safe classes (like they implemented an interface but then also had unique functions) like safe squares have to know how many bombs are near them but this is something that bombs would not need to handle, that wouldn't be enough? Is there any obvious way to utilize inheritance in minesweeper that wouldnt make the game design convoluted? I saw that it was listed as a popular concept used for this game.	I am making the game checkers and I wanted to use Inheritance and Dynamic Dispatch. My plan was to have each object on the board inherit from an interface called GamePiece. The GamePiece will also have abstract methods move() and canMove(). The checker class will have fields position and color it will also implement the move() and canMove(). The King class will do the same but have different Implentation of the methods. I just wanted to make sure this is technically use of this concepts because I was confused from the examples of what not to do given in the game proposal suggestions and guidelines. 	the move for the checkers would allow the checker piece to either move to the top right or top left. The king however could go backwards as well. I will probably use dynamic dispatch in the checkerboard object when I declare a movable piece to move.	I want to have levels on my game, but I don't understand how I/O would be used for levels. Could you explain how this would be used in this context? Thanks!	For my fourth concept for implementing Minesweeper, I don't know if I should go with inheritance or recursion. Can I just fill out both and then my TAs can tell me which one would be better?	For Connect Four, would the connect four pieces be piece objects or represented by the string ""O""? Does it matter if the game will consist of graphics?	I am doing chess, and am considering doing different types of pieces (e.g. pawn, queen, etc.) which all inherit from a greater piece class. I am wondering if this counts as filling the ""different defenders attack in different ways"" in the requirement for this core concept, since all of the pieces move in different ways and have different attributes (e.g. the pawn can be promoted if it reaches the other side).	Can we re-submit a game proposal if we do so before midnight? Like if we want to slightly change something?	Even though you guys used Tic Tac Toe, could I create a three dimensional version with some unique components that separate it somewhat from your version? It would be a 3x3x3 cube with the cube's core slot blocked out. Players take turns, but cannot play in the same horizontal plane two turns in a row. The game is played until the board is blacked out, and each 3 in a row is worth 1 point. If a player gets a point, they get a powerup where they can choose one turn to play in the same plane twice in a row etc, etc. 	There are 2 games that I'm interested in building but I'm not completely sure which one to do; is it okay if I submit proposals for both of them and choose which one to build out after getting feedback? (One of them is more interesting to me but is more complicated, and the other is much more standard).	My checked checkboxes are showing up blank in my proposal doc and I'm not sure why.. I write clear responses but all my checkboxes are unchecked. Is this okay or will I receive points off?	If I use a 2-D array to model the board for checkers, would I be able to use a collection for the purposes of undo that stores the previous orientations of the board or would that overlap with the use of 2-D array and so that would not count as a use of collections?	If I had a concept of enemies falling down from the top of the screen, would having them fall differently satisfy dynamic dispatch? For example, one enemy would just fall straight down, one enemy would zig zag, etc???	What if it moves diagonally and then bounces off the wall? Wouldn't that require substantial change to the move method? Would this satisfy?	To what extent will we be expected comment the code we write for the final project? Should we write Javadocs for every public method or is it sufficient to just explain things that wouldn't be clear otherwise? 	Hello y'all!

This is probably just a really simple question but when I call ""addMouseListener"" on the 2D board that I create, it puts out a red line underneath.

I think Eclipse is mad because it wants me to override mousePressed, mouseReleased... etc.

How do I get it so that I only do something when mouse is clicked?

Thank you,
Anders.


	Can I set the background to a picture of a checkerboard? Or do I have to manually create the checkerboard with code?	When are we getting feedbacks on our proposal? Want to make sure that the 4 concepts are valid before moving on to some of those parts. Thanks!	I have so far created the main PacmanGame class which creates the JFrame and all associated functions. I am now thinking of the best way to display my game. After much thought, I am stuck as to just drawing on the JPanel itself to create the map or whether I should add a gridlayout to the JFrame which holds JLabels inside each to draw. After instantiating each tile (using a tile constructor that reads  in the map data and dot data locations), I am not sure if it would be best to do this way or not since I could run into issues with having so many different JLabels inside this JPanel. Any help would be appreciated to move forward.	I'm trying to implement pacman as my game and I'm using a 2D array to set up the initial game board. The initial game board will be the same for each game (I'm not implementing levels), so is it okay for me to hardcode my initial values for where my borders / the dots that Pac-man eats? I know this isn't super efficient but I feel like it is the simplest way to implement.

	Hello, 

Some variants of chess have a rule that when a pawn reaches the last row of the board, the pawn ""turns into"" an additional queen for that player. Is my game of chess required to have this feature, given that not all variants of the classic chess game have this rule? 

Thanks!	I am planning to use a 2d array for my gameboard. However, I'm confused where I'm supposed to be creating the array in. Do I create the array within the JFrame?? I'm so confused	I'm using a 2D array to model the state of my board (as in non-moveable objects on the screen). However, I'm really confused as to how I can draw things within each array position. 

Currently, I am representing the board as a 2D array of ints where 0, 1, 2, and 3 represent different states of the board (AKA what stationary objects can be at that region). I define Board as a class that extends JComponent. In my constructor, I initialize all of the values to represent the initial state of my board. I know I have to override the paintComponent and preferredSize methods, but I really don't know what to do with paintComponent because I don't know how just knowing the element's coordinates in the array will orientate its drawing in 2D space.

I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, I've never used Swing before and I'm having a hard time understanding how all of these things fit together.	Hello! This week in recitation we went over some really useful slides, but I didn't see them posted on the google drive - would it be possible to upload them?

		private final int numYTiles = 36;
		private int tileWidth = frame.getContentPane().getWidth() / numXTiles;

Do I need a timer (as done in the Mushroom of Doom) code for this? How do I continuously repaint?	Hello!

I was working on my project and had to use a tutorial on oracle for reference (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/mouselistener.html). If we cite our sources, are we allowed to use similar code inspired by the tutorial (Like 
public class BlankArea extends JLabel { Dimension minSize = new Dimension(100, 50);
public BlankArea(Color color) { setBackground(color); setOpaque(true); setBorder(BorderFactory.createLineBorder(Color.black)); }
public Dimension getMinimumSize() { return minSize; }
public Dimension getPreferredSize() { return minSize; }}
for example)? Or should we refrain from referencing any outside material at all, even with citing sources?

David Li	Can we store JComponents within a JComponent? 
e.g. 4x4 gameboard with 16 tiles, each tile is a JComponent but the game board itself is also a JComponent	I'm interested in implementing Pac-man for my final homework assignment but I am having some trouble conceptualizing the model of the game-state. Pac-man works with a grid system so it seems only intuitive that I use a 2D array to help with my modelling. Here's what I've managed to work out so far:
1) I have a 2D array wherein each element in the array represented a piece of the game board. I'm thinking of filling the 2D array with ints such that each int represents something different within the gameboard environment (i.e. 0's represent a wall). 

2) I create a JPanel and set its layout to have the same dimensions as my 2D array. The JPanel will have access to my 2D array, so I will then loop through every element of the 2D array and will decide what to populate the next ""section"" of the JPanel grid with based on the int in the corresponding element of the 2D array. This distinction between the 2D array and the JPanel grid allows for the introduction of multiple levels if I so choose to implement that.

3) Here's where I get stuck: it seems intuitive to represent the walls and floor of the game board using ints in a 2D array, but I am unsure how to represent the location of my living objects (Pac-man and the ghosts). I am debating between a) representing, say, Pac-man as another int value in the 2D array, and b) having Pac-man be his own sub-type of the GameObj class.

Option b) seems more reasonable, but I am unsure how to represent the location of Pac-man if I were to implement him as an object. I can't simply rely on traditional x-y coordinates because Pac-man and the ghosts move in a quantized fashion. However, option a) seems unreasonable because it is easier to listen for arrow-key inputs and change Pac-man's position if he were an object instead of simply an int-value in a 2D array.

May I be offered any suggestions? Is my entire approach to the game incorrect?	Can we reuse the GameObj class in our project? As in, keep the class in its original form?	In the write-up, it says that we are not allowed to model that same state using a 2D array and a collection.

For some reason the text of the status JLabel never changes, suggesting that the mouse movement isn't being processed correctly.  However, when I use the same exact code for a mouseclick (simply changing mouseMoved to mouseClicked) the click is processed and the label text is changed.

	I am building Othello. My strategy is to accumulate a set of pairs of ints (x, y), which represent the coordinates of the tokens to be flipped, and then to iterate through the set and flip the token at each Pair of coordinates. I created a Pair class to hold these two ints. Initially, I was getting a Class Cast Exception when I tried to add a new Pair to the TreeSet&lt;Pair&gt;, and the error message said it was because Pair doesn't implement Comparable. I didn't think the ability to compare one Pair to another was critical to my program so I used @Override to insert a dummy compareTo method that always returns zero. Now, when I run the whole program, it only ever flips the first token added to the set, and I'm wondering if this is because it cannot compare the Pairs. If so, where can I find a model for writing a good compareTo function or what other ways might I be able to get around this issue? Thank you!	I was wondering if I could get some clarification as to what would qualify as Network I/O. I intended to make a Giphy API call based on some user input and get a GIF as a result, however on the proposal feedback I was told that this would not be complex enough to count as advanced Network I/O. What would be some possible examples of how Network I/O would differ from typical I/O? Thanks.	I have a JPanel that is made of a 2D array of Buttons. When I click, visually, it acts as if all the buttons have been clicked and all their values have been changed to match. However, when I use print statements, i find that my program correctly registers which button was clicked and changes only that button's value. I don't understand why visually, when I call repaint(), the entire 2D array of buttons is being repainted to match the button that was clicked. 	We are allowed to deviate from a traditional game's characteristics if they are too difficult to implement, correct?

For example, I am implementing PacMan, and instead of having the ghosts initial position be in ""Ghost Jail"" (like this image: 



I am having the ghosts start at other positions, as so:


My reasoning for this change is that if I were to place my ghosts in Ghost Jail, I would likely have to manually program their exit behavior from the jail. I figure this implementation is a little simpler even if it deviates from standard PacMan games.	Dear instructor,

	If I have an interface and I have multiple classes that implement that interface, is there any way to change which type of object any of the objects are?

I feel really frustrated- I was going to make whack a mole game and I drew a 3x3 grip on the canvas right now.

	Hi, I'm using the dynamic dispatch, so I have an abstract class for GameObj, and it has two other classes that extends this GameObj. 

But for one sub-class (call this A), I have a bit more methods than the other sub-class (call this B), and in that B class, I still need to implement those methods that it does not need but still in the abstract class (since class A needs them). How should I implement the methods that class B does not even need? Just hover the mouse to class name and let Eclipse do the auto implementation for me? 

Will that work?	Thanks! 
But I just wanna make sure- since my 2d array is the array of GameObj, so can I do this?:

if (map[i][j] instanceof A) {
        A a = (A) map[i][j];
        a.someMethod();
}

Because I need to call on some specific method of A, but it is not in the GameObj abstract class- I first cast the GameObj into its sub-class A and then I call on the method specific to A?

Thanks again~	For my game, I am creating a grid. I created it but now I’m having trouble with the size of the panel because the grid is a fixed size but every time I drag to open the panel and go past the size of the grid there is blank space that i don’t want. Any suggestions to either keep the size of the panel fixed along with my grid or edit the code so that the size of the grid changes with the size of my panel?	Leaving this unresolved because I'm not directly answering your question, but it is okay to have your game not be resizable if you don't want to implement resizability.	I have currently made my map and placed all of my pellets on the map. Would it be considered dynamic dispatch if I created a Pacman class and Ghost class that extend a sprite class which has fields for x and y position,  velocity in  x and y, and  a  move() method? I am not exactly sure how different these move() methods would be since essentially all I am doing is translating their x and y positions by some vx and vy.	Here's an example:

""files/instructions.txt""
This all works fine and the images/text files all show up in the game. But do I need to physically import them into eclipse to make sure they work during the demo?	If it's helpful for us, is it okay if we just copy and don't modify the GameObj class from Mushroom of Doom as long as it's not any of our four concepts?

Also, if we wanted to put our project on Github, how should we deal with this? Could we give credit to the 120 TAs for that class in the readme or would we have to rewrite a similar class ourselves?	Thank You! A follow-up q tho: Arent' Java graphics modules indexed from the top left have i as the y axis and j as the x axis? Like:

I got 5 points back on Midterm 2 after regrade requests and am wondering if the grade on the dashboard where we submit homework assignments will be updated to reflect this. Just want to make sure I receive the correct grade if the numbers are pulled from there instead of Gradescope. Thanks. 	I'm trying to implement a JLabel which displays the score and updates it as the user continues the game - I have a field in my game logic which is constantly being incremented and altered as the game goes on. I'm having trouble finding a viable ActionListener or some sort of listener to this JLabel which will re-set the score as it changed under the hood. Any suggestions? 	The problem is that I increment the score in a class that holds my logic that doesn't have access to the JLabel...does that make sense? I set the JLabel to a function that gets the current score, but the problem is that the score changes but the getScore function returns 0 at the beginning when I start the game and it doesn't update. 	Ok, so just to be sure: creating jlabels in my logic classes and then passing them into my main game class when I draw my frame is okay? 	I know I need to implement compareTo for objects that I want to add to a set. If these objects extend GameObj (from the Mushroom of Doom code), should I add an abstract method in the GameObj class? And then override in the subclass? I tried that but still get a ClassCastException when I add the objects to a set.	Are we allowed to have our game connect to a firebase kv database to store player inventory to allow for remote player inventory access? 	I am using the intersects method in GameObj to identify collisions between different moving particles on the screen. However, the collisions only sometimes are identified. Could this be because one particle is moving too fast relative to the other? I'm not sure why it wouldn't detect certain collisions.	I don't seem to be able to select the image- i have it in png is it supposed to be in a different type of format?	it should update because of the redraw function at the end of the function where I call the class method in, or am I misunderstanding how it works?	How come when you call snitch.hitObj(square) it works but not when you call square.hitObj(snitch)?	I used Eclipse to auto generate equals and hash code. I checked the boxes for positions and color.	I originally proposed implementing pacman traditionally (with a few added features). 

Instead, I'd like to do a different version of Pacman -- is this complex enough?: 

The game uses a blank canvas with Ghosts + Pacman (as opposed to a grid with little dots that Pacman must eat). 

1. The game asks you to eat Ghosts in a specific order (e.g. Red, Green, Blue, Orange, etc.) 

2. If you eat a Ghost of the wrong color, a new Ghost is added to the screen. 

    If you eat a Ghost of the correct color, the current Ghosts on the screen change colors (so it's harder for the user to plan in advance).    

3. You win by eating by 10 Ghosts in the specified order within 1 minute (or whatever numbers I find are appropriate).

All my added features to Pacman (from original proposal) will still be relevant (e.g. each color Ghost dies differently). Instead of I/O, I will likely be using JUnit to test the Model of my game (aka looking at the state, e.g. # of Ghosts on board; whether Ghosts have been captured in right order; whether generated color of new Ghost was correct)	I'm trying to figure out how to have mouse clicks make the mode switch, and as I tried to set up Mode, I saw that in the textbook (p. 339), it says to make Mode an enum, but in the PaintE demo, Mode is an interface that extends MouseListener. Why are these different? What are the benefits of making Mode an enum as opposed to an interface? Thanks!	My eclipse is not responding so I force quit it and when I reopened it all my code is gone.

Is there any way to recover it?

Was wondering what I should change to make this thing larger when I run the game function	So I'm currently working on getting the game gird to display (I'm doing Minesweeper), but when I attempt to draw the board, the Tiles are all drawn in the same place. Here is the loop I'm using, the x and y are height and width of the board:
public JPanel getBoard() {		for (int i = 0; i&lt;x; i++) {		for (int j = 0; j&lt;y; j++) {		//Add the button		return panel;	}
Is their any reason that the panel would add all the buttons to the same position? What ends up being displayed is a window is a bunch of tiles piled up in the (0,0) position in the grid.	Hi, I'm still a little confused- what do you mean by it's impossible to view? Do you mean it will be too hard for the code to run? And I kind of feel like I don't need larger intervals because I store the state of the 2d array of my game for every interval, so if I paint each element of the linked list also every interval when I hit replay, then I feel like it can better reflect the exact state from last round.	

So this is my tick() right now lol. I added a private int count to keep track of the linked list I go through. I have a setReplay so that the Game can interact with the isReplay value. Do you think this is fine?	Where online can I find the Graphics interface so that I can look at all of the different drawing methods?	In terms of moving Pacman inside his passageways, I am not exactly sure how to smoothly get him to move from tile to tile. Upon a keyboard click, there is a move() method that gets Pacman to move in the designated direction until he hits a wall but he is redrawn rather instantaneously as if already appearing at the edge of the wall. I think this occurs since his move() method changes his location in the map in terms of x,y location, redrawing him at that desired position as well.  How would I be able to move him by pixels as well as keep track of location in the map at the same time?? A thought was using a timer but this seemed like it would affect the ghost movements as well.	Hi,

I am implementing the game fishy, where you are a fish and eat other fish to get bigger. The simple version of the game will  produce fish of the same size throughout the game. I propose a more complex logic where I will:

1) constantly create edible fish from a normal distribution that scales with the size of user fish 
2) guarantee that there is at least one edible fish at play at any given time 

this would prevent the game from ever getting too easy or impossible

I'm making the traditional snake game with a few twists, and I'm having trouble trying to draw and move the snake. 

(1) I first assigned some of my board[i][j] (2d array of my canvas) to contain the Snake (line 86). 
(2) The *item name*.place() function basically places the item object on a random slot of the board, after it makes sure that the slot of the board doesn't contain anything.

Now, the problem is I don't know how to properly draw the snake nor move it... I was planning to traverse through the whole board (through two arrays) and check if that slot equaled to a Snake. But I realized this line (178) syntactically doesn't work (Snake is a subclass of GameObj). How am I supposed to approach this problem? 

Same goes to when I want the snake to move. Even if I find the HEAD of the Snake, how am I supposed to traverse through the whole board and assign the board to a new Object, if the above line doesn't compile? Am I not approaching the problem correctly? 2D array is one of my concepts, and I realize that I cannot use Collections with it, so I am so lost. 

Please help as soon as possible :( I went to office hours today but couldn't be helped because the queue was too long. 
I can post my code if you guys need it as well! 

Thank you!! 













	The 2-D array is storing objects of the GameObj class. So each cell(?) is either empty or stores a type of GameObj (in my case, a snake body part, mushroom, poison, etc.). And what I am trying to do is loop through the 2-d array with two for loops and allocate each cell to a snake body part, item, or nothing. But the problem is I don't know how I will be able to check what type of GameObj that cell is. 

For instance, if I want to draw the snake on the board, I will have to check if a Cell is a type of Snake (1). If it turns out to be a different item or empty, I won't draw anything. Otherwise, I would draw a rectangle. Yet the code (1) is failing, and I don't know how to fix it. :( 

(1) line 78 of the first screenshot 

I guess my question is, when the game first starts, my program assigns the board to be one of the three options. It makes a new Snake object at certain cells as seen in line 86 of the second screenshot. In (1), I want to check if a cell contains a Snake object. How would I write this so that my code compiles? 
	When I close out of my game and then hover my cursor over the green play button in Eclipse, it says Run Game(already running). So I think the reader is not being properly closed.	I had an Keylistener that moved a character on the screen based on the user press of the right and left arrows - was working perfectly in my Game class. Then, I add a Mousclick listener on a JButton which changes some logic state of the game. For some reason, when I run my game, the firing of the Mouseclick listener renders moving the main character (which is supposed to be taken care of by the KeyListener) ineffective. After I press that button on the screen, the character doesn't move and the game doesn't seem to be listening to my KeyPresses. Any reason this might be? 	I've set focusable, but I have both a JFrame and this inner JPanel. i end off the main by calling setFocusable for the Frame, but it's still not working, even though i call setFocusable for the specific JPanel right after the event handling	I'm trying to stop the timer with timer.stop(), but it keeps on running the timer because my JOption keeps on executing every time I press okay and another ""Game Over"" JOption pane opens up.

I'm building snake and was having trouble getting my keystroke events to register. Initially what I saw was my snake moving across page but I couldn't control it with the keypad.

Does this count as an advanced data structure?	If the higher the score the lower the number (like if the score was determined by how many moves it took you to do something and the goal is to do it in the least amount of moves) should we still display our scores in descending order or in order of what’s consider “highest” to “lowest”	For some reason, whenever I call set Text on my Jlabel I am getting a nullpointerexception. On the docs for setText is says ""the default value of this property is null."" What does this mean? A little confused as to how this would throw an exception, would love to know how I can get around it. Any suggestions? 	Besides the win condition ""Player x Wins"" status, are there any game status indicators Connect 4 should have?	Just want to double check:
The following would fulfill the I/O concept correct (Reader half)?(Not asking about validity of code, just whether or not it conceptually fulfills the category)

	I've never been to quad OH. Where in quad is it?	Can someone check this very brief proposal to make sure I'm good? Thank you

Game: Connect 4

2D Array:
Simulate the board. It will be a 2D Array of coin objects. Each coin object will know its own indices and color.

Collections:Stack. I will use this to keep track of player moves to allow an undo feature.

File I/O:
Keep track of game state, high score, etc.

J Unit Test:
Testing the board logic, coin class, stack logic, etc.

Again, thank you so much for the help at such a busy time.	Is it recommended to test our programs on the Moore computers that we'll be doing our demos on or should we assume that if it works on our end and compiles on the servers that it'll work the same on them.	Hi, 
I'm having some trouble understanding the mushroom code, specifically the playing state as a boolean in GameCourt. The default value is false, and the only time it could be set to true is in reset, but where was reset ever called when the game started? Thanks!	I wrote this in my game proposal, but for high scores for Connect 4 I am planning to do 1 point for a win, 0 for a tie, and -1 for a loss for each player, is this acceptable?	I'm trying to figure out how to end my game, and I want to do it in my main...the only problem is that an if-statement in the main will only check the field once instead of continually checking as the game goes on. Further, the tick() method i have doesn't have access to the JOptionPane and stuff that I want to manipulate when the game ends. Any suggestions? 	Hi, I have a follow-up question: I'm separating names and scores with an arrow ""-&gt;"", can I make my file to be a line of string without any white spaces? So that when I read in, I know exactly the substring before the arrow is a name and the one after is the score, so that I don't need to use token scanners or so?	    //ask how to short-circuit this 
    public void checkWin(int xPos, int yPos) {
    	if (checkVerticalWin(xPos, yPos) || checkHorizontalWin(xPos, yPos) 
    			|| checkDiagonalWin(xPos, yPos)) {
    		playing = false;
    		status.setText(""Winner is Player"" + colorName(currentColor));
    	}
    }
hello! I have a check win method that is currently structured like this. However, if this is the case, won't the program run the checkVerticalRun method, horizontal, and diagonal methods? I want it so that if checkVerticalWin is true, then I just short circuit and skip to the main part of the code right away. I see that I can use if else statements to do that, but is there another way to do it using booleans? 	Just to make sure that I implemented the ""Using JUnit on a testable component of your game"" concept in the right way.

What I did: I created a class called GameModel, which stores the main character, monsters in a List and blocks in another list.
This class has methods that allow me to update the main character's attributes, remove or add blocks/monsters, etc.
Then, I used JUnit to test the GameModel and its methods.

Is it a valid case for the ""Using JUnit on a..."" concept?	I have a JPanel that contains a MouseListener. For some reason, the Panel does not respond to mouse clicks following the first click on the panel. Any idea on how to fix this?	Never mind, I think I just have a problem with how I am painting things	is it good style to override equals for each class we make, or do we only need to do it for classes that we need to use the equals method for in our code?	For the sample game code that is given, I was wondering why we add an actionlistener to the jbutton. Couldn't we have added a mouselistener that called the reset function when clicked? If i'm not mistaken, actionlistener and mouselistener both have eventlistener as a super interface, but I am unclear about the difference between the two. 	Hi, I was testing my Whack a mole game, and everything goes pretty well, and I accidentally clicked outside the game while it's still playing, and then I get this:
2018-12-09 14:47:53.870 java[7040:34555223] IMKInputSession [0x7f995f4dbff0presentFunctionRowItemTextInputViewWithEndpoint:completionHandler:] : [self textInputContext]=0x7f995f4ee630 *NO* NSRemoteViewController to client, NSError=Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4097 ""connection from pid 0"" UserInfo={NSDebugDescription=connection from pid 0}, com.apple.inputmethod.EmojiFunctionRowItem


But other than this message, everything goes well. What does this mean, do I need to worry about that? And do we need to worry about the cases when the user accidentally clicks outside the game board? 
	Hi, 

I feel like it didn't. The went on, and because I clicked out, when I came back it shows I ran out of time so I lost. I guess this means the game is still running. but this line of red sentence kind of worries me. So do I need to handle those cases? I feel like I don't have to though.. Is that right?	For my game, I am making a slot machine and each box represents a slot in a 3*3 array. Whenever I press start, the game is supposed to randomly load one of out of 7 pictures. However, the pictures aren't showing on the slots, but I am not getting any error saying that the picture files aren't found.I wrote the following code for putting an image into the slot. Is there something wrong with it?
public void setImage() {		for (int i=0; i&lt;3; i++) {			for (int j=0; j&lt;3; j++) {				int no = (int)(Math.random()*7)+1;				icon[i][j] = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage(""c:\\Pictures\\Image""+no+"".png"");			}		}	}
	If our code throws exceptions when you do things a user would not be able to do (like changing the value of a final static constant so that it puts a piece out of bounds) is it okay or do we have to handle these?	Does anyone have any good resources that shows how to properly use J-Unit test with GUI? I have been trying to find a good resource, but everything I have found requires the use of multiple libraries or jar files and the implementation is convoluted. Does anyone have a straight forward resource that could show me how JUnit testing works?	Would the following algorithm to check if a player won in connect 4 be okay for the recursive criteria?
Basically, the algorithm starts in the top left corner (arbitrarily) and recursively calls on adjacent tiles, passing in its own color and an accumulation count. If the colors match, the accumulation count is incremented. If the count reaches 4, or the call reaches the edge of the grid, the function returns. If the colors do not match, the count is reset, but the call continues. 	Right, but I was thinking since the recursive algorithm can check in 1 pass of the grid, it would be better than checking it iteratively.	Any pointers on how to do it iteratively, one pass? I thought about it for a bit before trying the recursive one	In my game, connect 4, I have implemented an ai to play against the player (uses minimax alpha beta pruning w/ an option for depth)

since JUnit testing is a part of the core requirements I have picked, would I have to use JUnit to test the effectiveness of my AI?
	I have an action listener on a bunch of buttons that performs a few different tasks. One of those is to increement a counter representing the number of moves made. My issue is that I cannot call on moveCounter (a JLabel) .setText in this action listener. 

I keep getting the issue that it cannot be resolved. Any suggestions on how to call it?	Let's say three people get a score of 0 and ""Sam"" is the most recent one to get a 0 so he's the fourth person to get a 0 score. Is it okay if I just display the least three people that got a score of 0 and not Sam?	Do MouseEvent.getX(), MouseEvent.getY() give the coordinates of mouse relative to the component or the frame?	As I was trying to implement the file I/O, my game failed to appear. One TA and I worked on it, and by fixing the size of the frame, it began to show again. However, after running the same code a few times, the I'm having same issue, where it no longer appears. Any idea on why this is happening?	
If the state of the board is the top array, then the player makes a valid move (shifting the board up, left, right, down), then presses undo, normally it would just return to the top array. But I'm wondering if the undo in my game could set the board to a different version of the top array that is rotated, such as the second or third in this picture -- the middle array is the top one rotated 90 degrees to the right, and the bottom array is the top one rotated 180 degrees to the right.
	Should the instructions be displayed initially or should there be a button that brings it up?	So I'm doing chess, and I've currently implemented my board as a JPanel (GridLayout) of JPanels, and whichever panels have pieces in them contain JLabels with icons in them. I would like to change the icon of the JLabel for a particular cell, but I'm not sure how I can just do so. I'm currently getting each component of the JPanel, removing each of them, and then adding a JLabel with the icon set to the desired image, but that doesn't seem to be working	how does getx() and getxonscreen() differ?	So I have a 2D array of Jtextfields, and a submit button at the bottom of the page. I want to read all the data from the jtext fields when the user clicks on submit. How can I implement this?	No it's not. It's three classes and doesn't have an excessive amount of lines either. How will they be run on the Moore100 labs? Do those computers have Eclipse? 	Hi I know this has been answered before, but another TA said I'm allowed to use code on Stack Overflow (just if it is unrelated to my File I/O concept and I cite) and suggested that I post on Piazza as well. I found a method that converts a TreeMap into a Map. Separately, I have implemented and used my own code for read( ) and write( ). For my Collections concept, I implemented the undo concept as well.

Is this all right?

The code is pasted below.

Thank you so much!

	I'm using the google protobuffer library and have included the jar in my project (as well as modified the JARS line in the Makefile if that is of relevance), but can't seem to submit it through the submission system. Compiling using the makefile works fine on my own computer once the JARS has been modified, so I'm not sure what's going wrong.

The error message I get is:
src/Protocol.java:1934: error: package com.google.protobuf does not exist com.google.protobuf.GeneratedMessageV3 implements

Which suggests it is not including the JARS in the classpath in the server buildsystem.

(Sidenote: the make run doesn't seem to work when using additional jar files since make run doesn't added the JARS to the classpath, should I modify the make run command to include the JARS variable?). 	Every time I call repaint in my code after a keyRelease, it doesn't call paint component. 	How can I convert a String[] to an int[]?

Say my String[] is {""123"", ""34"", ""4""} and I want an int[] that is {123, 34, 4}.	So if we were doing chess but didn't implement en passant, how many points would we lose on complex game logic, assuming we implemented the following features:

- Promotion
- Check
- Checkmate/Stalemate/Draw
- Castling	Just curious - what category does pawn promotion fall under?	How do you do a new line in a JLabel? '/n' doesn't seem to be having an effect. I saw a previous post on it but that involves HTML and I don't think it allows for us to use Java string variables	
Game State [9%]. The game should have a way of displaying the player’s status (This could include running score, number of lives, time elapsed, etc.) as appropriate to the game. Those values should be incremented, decremented, or manipulated appropriately as the game progresses. There should be a detectable end state to your game. (This could include winning, losing, running out of time, etc.

For Connect Four, is it sufficient that the way we display a players status is that we display whose turn it is?
(assuming we have created a detectable end state to that game that is when someone connects 4)	On the rubric, it says we need to have a way of displaying the player's status (""Game State"") as appropriate to the game. For Connect Four, for example, is an appropriate ""Game State"" to just have a message of ""Play now!"" until a player wins and then a message of ""Player 1 wins!"" or ""Player 2 wins!""?	For the game ConnectFour the traditional size of the board is 6 by 7, but I am making mine 8 by 8.. is that okay?

	If I am doing MineSweeper, is displaying the number of flags that the player has used satisfy this requirement?
	This might be a silly question, but my game shares some similarity to the mushroom of doom game (World's hardest game) and I want to make moving enemies that are circles and I want to make a lot of them that move vertically, just 40 pixels apart. How can I draw multiple enemies upon the game's start, not just one? 	since the square doesn't take in dimension coordinates on where i can put it, how do i pick specifically where it's drawn?	Is there a way for me to display the number of the numbered cell in MineSweeper, or can I do it by the gradient of colors to indicate the number of the cell?	for some reason my code is not responding at all to any sort of keyPresses. What should I check to make sure that I am responding correctly to keyPresses?	I fixed the null pointer exception that was just because I didn't do ""files\"" before my filename. Now I'm getting a NoSuchElementException, and I don't know why. I know that is usually called when you try to access a next and there is nothing there. Whenever I try to do stuff in the file, it just deletes the stuff I had written, but i made sure to call flush before close in the write function. I think the issue is with my read function because in the try catch, it never reaches anything in the while (reader.ready()) block... I printed out reader.ready() and it was false.	Any thoughts? Not sure what I’m gonna do about this thing. Sorry to be annoying it’s just super bizarre and I’m not sure where to turn 	Hi,
I looked into the javadoc for JOptionPanel, but I didn't quite figure out how to show the message in two lines because what i'm trying to show is a bit long.

Thanks!
	In order to use dynamic dispatch in my game, I would like to create two types of enemies which have different movement patterns. I intend to create an abstract class which extends GameObj and add two more methods, one of which will be overridden in order to change movement between the two enemies. Is this extensive enough to count for dynamic dispatch?	Right now, every time a user clicks my New Game JButton, I show them the instructions for the game, then they hit okay, and then I prompt them to enter their information using a showInputDialog box. 

However, I realized that when I click New Game in the middle of the game and I cancel out of the showInputDialog box (instead of answering information), it completely stops my game play and I have to force quit the application. I've handled the null pointer exception that was thrown, but should I do anything else to handle this error? I can add a note to the showInputDialog box to warn the user, but I don't know what else to do.	If we are doing a game with complex instructions, like chess, can we have a paragraph with basic instructions and then have a link to a website with more detailed instructions?	I just wanted to make sure I correctly understood the concept of game state.

I am referring to the part of the grading rubric labeled ""Game State.""  I am making checkers and my solution for having game state was to have the amount of moves displayed at the end of the whole game when it is stored in the leaderboard.

Hi, I'm doing Minesweeper. However, it seemed like I can only draw the initial state of the game and am able to intialize (since the number of mines showed is correct). However, my uncover and flag method doesn't work at all. I tried several methods suggested on piazza about repaint() and JPanel.updateUI() and etc but nothing changes. So I'm wondering whether it is the problem in the draw method or more likely thep problem in how the draw is updated? Below I attached the code for draw method in the cell class, board class (my board class essentially just call the draw in cell class) and the repaint and mouselistener from game court (repaint called board.repaint in the game court method).Thanks very much in advance!!	ohh the mouselistener and draw method are from two pictures and are functions from two different places. Sorry about the confusion. I did this (attached) by adding the repaint method inside the mouse listener I have but it also doesn't seem to change anything. Where else could I look for whether the state has been updated or not? Thanks a lot!	Hi Jane, thank you very much for the reply! So I added print statement in all three places and it seemed like only the repaint in the tick() method has been printed (keeps printing ""hiiiii3""). But the other two in the mouse listener does not. Wondering where I should go from here? Thank you very much again for all your help!! Really appreciated.

	Hi Jane! Thanks again and it worked omg! The other thing that happened is that one of the image I imported cannot get displayed on the screen. I could have bomb on the screen but not the flag (however the flag method is working since the counter I have is changing number as I clicked to the right cell). Is it because of the resolution of the picture or anything that it cannot get displayed? Thanks again!!!	ohh yes it worked! Originally it didn't print out the statement. Then I realize it is the problem in the condition of the else if statement - it should be 
else if (c[x][y].isFlagged()) instead of 
else if (!c[x][y].isCovered() &amp;&amp; c[x][y].isFlagged()) since the originally one requires it to be flagged and covered, which is wrong in logic. Thanks a lot for your help!!!
	I have two questions:
First: In the proposal, I said that my game would have:
Different types of monsters:- Ghosts (which can move horizontally or vertically) and these ghosts can be killed- Monsters that throw fire (these monsters can be killed)- Plants (which cannot be killed)Different types of blocks:- Static blocks- Blocks that can fall and kill the player- Reward blocks (they give an extra life to the player when they are hit)- Blocks that turn into reward blocks when hit
I changed it a little:
Different types of monsters:- Ghosts (which can move horizontally or vertically) and these ghosts can be killed --&gt; change: they move only vertically, but can be killed- Monsters that throw fire (these monsters can be killed)  --&gt; did not changed- Plants (which cannot be killed) ---&gt; change: they move vertically, but cannot be killedDifferent types of blocks:- Static blocks --&gt; did not change- Blocks that can fall and kill the player  --&gt; no blocks that can fall and kill the player, but I added blocks that appear ""from nothing"" instead- Reward blocks (they give an extra life to the player when they are hit) ---&gt; reward blocks can give an extra life, but they can also kill the player- Blocks that turn into reward blocks when hit ---&gt; did not change

However, I changed what game I am making. Do I need to redo my project proposal?  	Can instructions just be a showMessageDialog that you have to close to play the game?	What does this look like? (LinkedList) myList.removeLast()?	This might be a dumb question, but I just want to make sure my file path is correct. I'm particularly confused about .jars but I think this is the correct setup.

(i.e. I sort the one that is shown to the user but under the hood, the leaderboard is not sorted)	Hi, my game only has three levels and is easy to finish, so I currently am using least amount of deaths as a high score. After completion of the game , i prompt the user for their name, and i store it in a list of pairs (name, # deaths). This is what i'm doing for I/O

However, if the user doesn't finish the three levels for whatever reason, I am thinking about prompting them for their name when they try to quit the game, and then saving their game in a different list of pairs (name, level) so that they can resume their current level when they log back in. Would this be a way to use both collections and I/O?	        		boolean allLetters = inputName.chars().allMatch(Character::isLetter);

	Hi, I really have some trouble debugging why when the snake hits its own body, I'm always 1 tick ahead? I basic logic is to add a new SnakeBody in the moving direction and then remove the 0 index. 

void tick() throws IOException {        if (playing) {        	// update position        	updateCoor();        	       	sk = new SnakeBody(COURT_WIDTH,COURT_HEIGHT, Color.MAGENTA, xCoor, yCoor);        	snake.add(sk);        	if (snake.size() &gt; length) {        		snake.remove(0);        	}        	        	// eat the apple        	if (apple.intersects(sk)) {        		apple = new Apple(COURT_WIDTH,COURT_HEIGHT, Color.CYAN);        		tickCount += 100;        		length++;        	}        	        	// hit the walls - death        	if (sk.hitBoundary() || hitItself(snake.get(0)) ) {        	playing = false;                 status.setText(""Oooops you lose!"");                 tickCount = 0; // reset score        	} else {				// update the 2D array        		board.update(snake);    			board.update(apple);    		    			// update the score label    			score.setText(""Score : "" + tickCount);    		    			repaint();        	}        }	} 
	Sorry Jenny, I should’ve been more clear. I didn’t paste all of my code because I was sort of showing the gist logic of my tick() function, which unfortunately didn’t make it easier.So I have a class SnakeBody which basically scores the position and color. And snake is an arraylist of snakebody. When the timer ticks, I added a new SnakeBody to the arraylist in the moving direction by updating x and y (private int fields in GameCourt). So the moving part and eating apples part work perfectly fine but when I’m checking hit wall or hit itself it should’ve stopped 1 box earlier. As you can see in my screenshot, the snake head should’ve stopped right after it hits the body.In my tick(), is this logic right?1. Update snake position2. If eats apple, do something 3. If (hitWall || hitItself) { //die} else { update my board. Repaint the board.}So the new SnakeBody shouldn’t be shown after it hits itself because the repaint method won’t be called. But I was still very confused why the next state is painted as shown in my screenshot.Thank you for your patience and help!!	I'm planning on storing the ""moves"" in minesweeper in a LinkedList, but what exactly would be the representation of the moves? I'm having trouble representing the moves in a tangible, accessible sort of way	I've been doing that, but it still doesn't seem to work. Every time a click happens (and thus the board state changes), I'm adding the current state of the board (board.clone()) at that time to my LinkedList. My undo function essentially removes the last item in the LinkedList and then attempts to set the current state of the board to the new last item (the previously 2nd to last item), and repaints it.

Am I doing something wrong here?	Does GUI test including testing the px value of a component after calling .move(), for example?	I just want to make sure that what I am doing is not GUI testing. What does GUI testing include?	Hi, I'm working on drawing the image for the minesweeper. However, the image I imported for flag could not work (I tried several images) aka it never showed up when I right clicked. But the tracking function I have for how many mines are flagged does change correctly. But I'm implementing this the exact same way as I did for bomb (which works correctly and show up all the time). Any suggestions? Thanks!	I am confused about testing my testable_component. So I am implementing checkers and I have a Gamepiece which I can make it go left and right. I also have a board that handles who's the winner, creates a board, and all that stuff.

So as per instructions I shouldn't test the GamePiece as it is low-level ?	I have a JLabel that takes in String from the GameCourt class. This string, however, changes every time gameCourt is reset. GameCourt itself does reset and the updates show on the screen. However the JLabel remains the same. I've added print statements and know that the string is updating as it should. My JLabel is not final. Where could the problem be?	I have also tried calling repaint() on the frame and the JLabel directly after calling reset and that still doesn't update the JLabel	Hi, I'm quite confused how game works. At the end of the class there is a try catch block surrounding reset. However, there are also the buttons for reset. If I click the reset button, does the reset at the bottom just not run?
	Hi, I'm just a little confused on how to implement turns. I have a card game similar to Uno and I'm stuck on how to actually prompt a turn and make an action out of it.	Hi Jane! Hope you're having a great day. 

I just received an email from the CIS110 Head TA's of this content:

Hi Subin, 

We noticed that applied to return next semester, but said you were also considering other opportunities. We need you to confirm whether or not you’re returning by this Friday so that we can plan our hiring for next semester correctly. 

Sincerely, 
Head TAs
I was wondering if it would be possible to hear back by this Friday regarding the 120 TA recruitment. I understand that it is a tough request and was wondering where to proceed from here. 

Thank You!

Best,
Subin 	So do I have to display the high scores automatically every time after they win/lose? Or I can just have a button that allows them to check the highest socres?	I have an EventHandler that implements ActionListener, which basically allows the user to change the settings of the game THROUGH a preference window (a drop down menu ). I already have functions in other classes that I have tested that basically test this functionality.

Should I create a JUnit test based on my described implementation of EventHandler?	I have a picture I want to use as my background, but I don't know how to shrink it to fit the window. I'm modeling it as a JLabel but the picture itself is too big for the frame. If I set bounds for the JLabel, it crops the picture rather than resizing it. Even is I use pack for the frame, the picture is too big to be displayed on the screen and the frame maxes out. Is there a way to shrink the image to the frame size using swing?	So I have this code which takes a file that is labeled for example ""9_spades.png"", and turns it into a Card object. The first System.out.println() I have works as expected, I get 52 cards, 13 spades, 13 clubs, 13 diamonds, and 13 hearts. But, the for loop I have outside of the constructor outputs the same card type: diamonds. The weird thing is I use this in order to get my images and when I play the game the images come out as different cards, I don't know what the problem is here or how to fix it.	Nope, the cards show up fine, and they're all different, it's just that they all have the same ""diamonds"" suit when I call the ""getCardtype"" function on the Card object	For simplicity's sake, let's say I have the Square in Mushroom of Doom. What would the easiest way be able to display text on the object that is a part of it? ie: the text moves along with the square as you move it. So in the Mushroom of Doom example, you could make the text on the Square display ""square"".	Would it be feasible to create a variable that holds a JLabel inside my gameObject class?	Hi,
I noticed that there are 5% grade on the instructions of our game- should that be in a pop up dialogue windwon as soon as we open our game using JOption? Thanks.	I just realized that the reason why it took so long is because I didn't press the ""ok"" button in my game popup. Should I change it so that I don't need to press the ""ok"" button? 	According to this, hashmaps don't extend Collections in Java, but can we count them to satisfy the collections core component of the game?	Does displaying the board with the coins that the players have placed so far count as displaying game state? The wording of it seems like we need a number somewhere that represents something but does this count?	Before my game starts, I must run an algorithm in the background. As a result, my game is slow. Will I be penalized for this?	mostly the loading time but since there's a lot going on in the background during the game as well, the gameplay is a bit slow too	If I am counting the number of cells cleared as the score in the game, can my second thing stored be the amount of time it took the person to play the one game? or are these things too similar?	Do we need to implement a reset button? Or is just closing the window and running a new game when someone wants to play again ok?	How can you have one image on top of another in swing?	I'm currently implementing the game ""Scrabble"" for the final project. I was wondering if a game of this difficulty could count as ""complex game logic"" for one of the design requirements. Apologies if it is last minute, just in implementing over the entire weekend and past week, it took much longer than expected and I feel it is of similar difficulty/complexity to a game like chess and much harder than a typical game like minesweeper, connect four, etc. 

Here's why I feel it could count as ""complex game logic"":

There's numerous different nuances in the game. Tiles could be played anywhere on the board, but only certain formations are ""valid""/legal in the scrabble rulebook. One complexity is first determining if a play is legal. This branches off into numerous cases depending on where tiles are played, what they are, and how many were played. 

Next is scoring, as there are ""power up board spaces"" scattered around that could impact how the play is scored and words must be scored in all four directions. 

Lastly are nuances such as what happens at the end of the game, blank/wildcard tiles, as well as implementation of the dictionary.

There's even a tournament structure / organization similar to chess:
http://www2.scrabbleplayers.org/w/Welcome_to_NASPAWiki

And a 55 page rulebook: http://www.scrabbleplayers.org/rules/rules-20161201.pdf
Although, my java version will not cover most of this, as most it is fluff about in person etiquette and I'm also not keeping a timer. I'll mainly be covering sections V, the appendix, and fundamental Scrabble rules. 




Let me know if this would be approved! Only asking because it was much harder than anticipated due to all the rule complexities and running out of time to implement another requirement like I/O
	Thanks, how much credit would be given if this were my fourth design requirement?	Hi! I've been trying to submit my game for about 15 mins and the ""Loading... please wait"" message just stays forever. I've tried submitting maybe 7 or 8 times on a few different browsers but same issue. Not sure if others are experiencing this too, but is it an issue related to too many people submitting right now?	Hi! My Snake game was working perfectly, file I/O and everything, until I shifted around some files, added Makefile, and zipped up my project for submission. Now, whenever the game ends, instead of displaying high scores, an IOException is thrown and I'm super confused why. This was all working just before this :( Any ideas what might be causing this/what I should do?

This is the code throwing the IOException:
	How do I get the text String input from a JOptionPane? I tried using 
String name = nameEntry.showInputDialog(""Enter Your Name:""); but I don't know if this is right.	does this mean we are not allowed to use simpler formats if it makes sense in the context for our game? for example if we are saving the state of an integer array, can we just store each integer in the order they show up in the array without any other characters like commas or semicolons, and then when we read it in we simply populate the array with each integer in order?	Is there any way to know if my game is working correctly after submitting ? Right now I get a successful compilation but just wanted to make sure.	Will the warnings in the image below prevent the game from running correctly?

Hi,

On the first screen (before the game starts), I prompt the user for a username, and then I store that username. However, in a different class, I want to be able to retrieve the username so I can store it in a collection along with the level they are currently on so I can save the game state.

I'm trying to create some tests to test if the snake moves in a desirable manner by comparing two boards, however, the apple's position was randomized. How would I be able to create an expected color[][] with an uncertain position for the apple in my testing?

Hi, I don't really understand why this returns 2000 every time. I understand thiere is a synchronized keyword so only one thread runs each time, but how do we get 2000? Thanks.	

So when each counter runs, it will return 1000, is it that, when we have the synchronized keyword, t2 will wait until t1 is finished? So it will be 1000+1000=2000? How does it work?	

Hi, I'm confused about the last point- what does ""memory never reclaimed"" means? 

BTW do we need to worry about the adavance java topics a lot?	Hi, thanks for the reply! I still have some follow-up questions tho... I'm really not good at JAVA ASM... 

For the first one, when the static fields are stored for the first time, where are they stored on ASM?

Thanks!	Hi, if my midterm regrade request was approved, I just want to confirm that the new grade be reflected in the gradebook?

Would it be alright to say that we would utilize collections and insert all of the elements of the array into a treeset, and then return the treeset size, or would we be expected to use for loops in a question like this. 	

Why is i a static error? Wouldn't that simply rewrite what x is --&gt; similar to String x = ""hi""; followed by int x = 10; ? 

The answer states that there would be a "" NoSuchElementException on second iteration in third if"". Wouldn't the loop just break, since the first iteration would move the pointer 3 times, and then when it checks if the iteratior hasNext it would be false and break? If not, why specifically the third if of the second iteration? Wouldn't it break on the first if, since it can only execute iter.next() 3 times maximum? Not 5? 	Any update?	Hi Jane! Hope you’re having an awesome Friday. I was just wondering what happened with regards to the hiring as today is the deadline I need to report to the CIS 110 head TA’s.

Question 1 h on the fall 2016 final exam reads ""JUnit-style testing can rule out all possible bugs in the code for a class that implements Java’s Set&lt;A&gt; interface."" and the answer is false. Why is this? What aspects can JUnit not test?	But if src is of length 1 ([3]), we can't retrieve the data at src[1] because there is only an element at the 0th index, right?	so in terms of hierarchy, would B be a subtype of JComponent and class A?	For question 4.4, if the ""this"" keyword was removed from line 4 in the code, after doing super.m() and printing out ""A.m"" would class A's n method be executed or class B's n method? Does the ""this"" keyword play a big role in determining what n method is executed?


	For i), why do they have to write C.create() 
Why can you just say let c = create()

Why does the program crash with a StackOverflow exception?	Hi,

It was my understanding that if the == is true they have the same spot in memory thus the same value so I was confused as to how this is false, Thank you.	That makes sense.

Thank you so much!  

	Hi! I was wondering what the exact reason was for “two instances of the same java class are subclasses of each other” being false. Is it because they are the same hierarchy? 	
In this question, when we call mk_counters (), where is the reference cnt stored? (I thought of it sort of as a local variable in java) Whenever we call mk_counters () and return the (ctr, ctr)'s, is there a separate cnt for each of them or would it be the same reference? (I assume that there would be separate ones). 

And finally, in this case, this question is related to the concept of ""closure"" because we are changing the contents in the reference without actually referring to it (sort of like a setter method or increment method in java that changes values of private fields?) 	What is the effect of statically typing all of the letter objects A instead of by their dynamic classes(B-E)?	
What is an example of a function being stored in a heap and having local copies of variables on the stack? 	Hmm, doesn't closure or private state keep the variables in the heap though not the stack?	does the info for static variables go on the stack instead of the heap?	when we say ""super(pt.getX(), pt.getY());"" is that the getX method in the point class or the displaceable class? Whats the benefit to extending the circle class with DisplaceableImpl as opposed to simply implementing Displaceable?

	Why would we create an interface versus a class then have sub classes? Is it because single inheritance?	Based on the slide below, shouldn't this be true?



	Is this syntax (from above) a method signature without a modifier (ie, no public/private/protected) or is this ""Static type : function call"" just allowed by lambda syntax bc it's an anonymous class (or something else entirely?!)?

"	Since in list_of_set, the set is already an order list with no duplicates, couldn't we just return the given set as the body of the function? Like :
let list_of_set (s: 'a set) : 'a list = s

I feel like this is too easy though.	what about for list_of_set?	If I used set_of_list to test list_of_set, do I still need to test set_of_list? I feel like the tests would like the same since you have to use both of them. 	Are we assuming that the set passed into list_of_set has no repetitions and is sorted in ascending order? I'm a little confused by the directions. 	So, a set is a list, and the invariants state that this list is in ascending order and contains no duplicates. But if this were the case, would a test like the one below not be valid?

  let test () : bool =   list_of_set(set_of_list [1; 4; 6; 3; 3; 6]) = [1; 3; 4; 6]    ;; run_test ""set_of_list: duplicates and unsorted"" test
	To test list_of_set, is it okay to create a set using add prior to the tests, and then using that in our tests? I'm not sure how else you can instantiate a set explicitly to test the function.	A list sorting function to use in list_of_set.  Is this not necessary?	let test () : bool =
  list_of_set (set_of_list [1; 2]) = [1; 2]
;; run_test ""list_of_set: non-empty set"" test
is this an acceptable way to test list_of_set or do I have to use the add function? and like add continually to construct the set??
I mean something like:
add 1 (add (2 empty)
	Does list_of_set work only with integers or should we also return sorted other types like strings?	HI,

I have all my set_of_list passed in listSet, however, all list_of_set fails besides empty set. I'm wondering why this happens? I think the list_of_set  should simply return s. But all test cases failed.

Thanks! 	But all other functions that I used in list_of_set (add, remove and set_of_list) passed the tests. Any idea what may lead to the error?  Thanks!	this was for the implementation of list_of_set	Would this be a valid test for list_of_set because I feel it tests set_of_list more than it tests list_of_set?

"	can we use a recursive helper function? 	I see that rainfall isn't defined as recursive, meaning we can't use recursion.
Can we use helper functions that are recursive or is that just avoiding the problem? Sorry if this is a dumb question, I just can't think of how to tackle this problem without doing anything recursive.	I know that this question is very similar to other ones that have been asked about this problem, but I read through those answers and am still confused.

Can I use a recursive helper function in lieu of the rainfall function? What I mean is can the body of the rainfall function just be a call to a helper function?	If we are not using recursive in our function, should we take out the rec?	If we declare a variable at the beginning of the recursive function, would it get rewritten to the original value every time a recursive call is made, or would it only change when we have code in the function to change it?	For the capitalize function, are we supposed to simply implement the function or are we required to use the recursive transform function somehow?	are we allowed to call a helper function/ insert an inner-function that uses recursion for the truncate function (in simpleQueue)?	What do you mean by inner recursive function?	In almost all of the functions given in LinkedQueue, whenever there is a recursive helper function inside the main function, it is called using the in keyword before the function name. I was just curious why we need to do that?	All of my other tests besides this one are passing so I assumed the issue was related to the value being there multiple times. I'm using a recursive helper function. Can I check somehow that this function is actually recursing?	So would I have to define a helper function to use an inner recursive function?
	What would be the best way to go about that? Should I have an additional parameter for my inner recursive function?	Can I use a recursive helper function in my make_control? I am using it to help with the change_value portion of make_control?"
"	In the two test cases that are provided to us, why do we not have to provide an expected output for the test? I have provided the example below. 

let test () : bool = not (exists [false; false]);; run_test ""exists all false"" test

Shouldn't it be 
let test () : bool = not (exists [false; false]) = false;; run_test ""exists all false"" test	Just to be clear, for the following test cases:

A) let test () : bool =
not (exists [false; false]);; run_test ""exists all false"" test

B)
let test () : bool = not (exists [false; true]);; run_test ""exists all false"" test

A would return true and B would return false for a properly implemented function because of the not operator?

"	I'm a little confused by the answer for channels. Do we pick the name of the channels or is there a function that assigns names automatically? 	I'm having this problem and option 1 is still giving me the same error.

I want to remove multiple channels from my channelSet, so wouldn't copying the ChannelsToDelete into a different set and then iterating through that set to delete the select channels just give the same issue?	where are channels defined?	can a user be on multiple channels?	If a client/user is disconnected from the server, do we have to also remove them from all the channels they are in? 	But what if the channels have different names and the same users? I thought we return that ServerError only if they share the same name?	I'm trying to debug the case where the user being deregistered is the owner of multiple channels. I've figured out that my recipients are not what the should be. For example, if ""User0"" is the owner of firstChannel (which also has User1 in it) and secondChannel (which has User2 in it), my recipients for the broadcast should be User1 and User2. However, when I deregister User0, my recipients field is actually blank.

I think my issue comes down to how I am implementing the getChannels() method. I have been calling keySet() to get the names of all the channels that I want to iterate through in order to find others users who are in the same channels as a given user. However, because keySet() is backed by the map, when the map is later changed to delete the channels that the user who is being deregistered owns, the users in those deleted channels are not notified of the deregistration.

I'm really confused though because I've been trying a lot of different things to encapsulate state. I've tried making a new map and copying over the current state of the map using putAll and I've unsuccessfully tried to use clone. What else can I try to encapsulate state here?

	I am confused about if ALL the clients have to be informed that the user was disconnected, or only the ones that were in the channels with the user.
Also, if the user who got disconnected owned several channels, those channels should be deleted, do the members of those channels get notified?	What is this test case?
deregister owner of multiple channels removes channels: channel1 does not exist	what if when there are no channels?	I'm having a lot of trouble debugging my code for the case when deregistering  a User who owns multiple channels. Do you have any suggestions how to go about this?

Hello! Interestingly, Format2 is passing while Format 1 and Format 3 aren't. They are returning 
java.lang.AssertionError: This is a bad format
Does this mean that it's returning an error or not returning an error? (my guess is that it's not returning the desired error). How should I fix this issue? Doesn't catch divide Format 1 (,correct) into 1 component only? (correct)

"	Hi, I'm a little bit confused about how to implement this method-

This image is my GameCourt: my game is Whack A Mole, and when I initialize my game, I just make each unit square either a WAMTile (which means it's empty), or a WAMMole (which means there is a mole that the user can whack/click on). 

This image is the paintComponent method at the end of the GameCourt class.
I think I'm right to call map[i][j].draw(g) every time I want something to be drew, but my WAMMole and WAMTile have the exactly the same draw method.

I have a WAMGameObj as an abstract class, and my WAMTile and WAMMole are just sub-classes (because I want to use dynamic dispatch), but their draw methods have the same syntax. 
So when I call .draw(g) in paintComponent, how does the program know that I'm drawing a mole instead of a tile, or I'm drawing a tile instead of a mole? 
Or I should change the way I write my code?

I wanted to come to the OH today but I have a review session this evening and I really don't want to wait, so plz help ~~~

Thank you!	Do I necessarily have to draw the mole on top the tile? Ok maybe my naming is little bit confusing- my WAMTile is just the background, my WAMMole is the mole, so what I'm doing is that either this unit square is the background or it is a mole, so when there is a mole poping out, or the mole disappears, I simply replace one GameObj with the other, so I simply don't need to draw anything on top of the other. I hope that's ok. Is it OK?

And for the draw method, can I cast the map[i][j] into WAMMole and draw the mole / cast the map[i][j] into WAMTile and draw the tile? I kind of share this draw method in the abstract class and I want to use dynamic dispatch for my game...

Thank you!	In O Caml, if you try to see if two functions are structurally equal, an error is produced. However, if you try to see if they are referentially equal, O Caml allows this.

I was trying to frame my question in a way where everyone could use it, but I didn't really know how to phrase it without giving my code away. My implementation of tree_of_list is as follows:

 HigherOrder.fold(fun (x: 'a) (acc: 'b tree) -&gt; insert x acc) Empty l
The way I am understanding fold is that ""x"" is the first element of the list and ""acc"" is what we have so far, in this case, it would be the tree after each insertion. The anonymous function then uses insert on the current element of the list and the ""tree so far"" to construct the BST. However, my test cases are failing. Is this intuition incorrect?	Having some trouble on the reverse function - seems the input type is different - any tips?

This is my code:

let reverse (l: 'a list) : 'a list =  fold (fun x acc -&gt; acc @ x) [] l
	Hi!

Do we have to annotate the input type for the fun in fold functions/all anon functions?

fun (x: int) (acc: int) -&gt; x + acc
vs.
fun x acc -&gt; x + acc

Is the second one acceptable?	If the function you pass into fold only needs one input, say: (fun (acc) -&gt; 2 + acc), do we need to include the other input as well: (fun (h) (acc) -&gt; 2 + acc)?	But does the anonymous function always take in ""x"" and ""acc"" as arguments? 	For the anonymous functions, do we need to include the type of the input? Or it doesn't matter?

For example, fold (fun x acc -&gt; xxx) or fold (fun (x : int) (acc: bool) -&gt; xxx.

Thanks!	This is my from_list code:

let from_list (l: 'a list) : 'a queue = let l1 = fold(fun x acc -&gt; acc@[x]) [] l in fold(fun x acc -&gt; enq x acc; acc) (create ()) l1

The list is reversed to get the right order in the queue (when using enq in fold).	Why does replacing ys with acc not work?
	    let a = create() in 
      fold (fun x acc -&gt; enq x acc) a l;
      a
I'm stuck with a bug where the function returns a unit instead of a queue. Would there be a way to fix this problem? My idea was to enque each element of the list to an accumulated queue.  	is the answer to compose: fold (fun x acc -&gt; x acc) [] list? 	In fold on lists, our function is of type
'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b
and our function is something like
fun x acc -&gt; x + acc
The x is the head of the list and the acc is the result of the recursive call on the rest of the list.
If we have a tree, now we will have a recursive call on both the right and left subtrees, so our function will look like
fun x l r -&gt; x + l + r
Where l is the result of the recursive call on the left subtree and r is the result of the recursive call on the right subtree.

And so we need the type to be
'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b

Also, can I make this public?	Would this work?

List.fold_right (fun x acc -&gt; pair x acc) ws space(0,0)
	Hi y'all,

So I'm pretty set with fold1 — it makes sense-ish.

But with 5.b, fold2, I'm super confused. Fold 2 takes in an anonymous function, which is (fun x _ –&gt; enq x q). It also takes in the base case ( ) and the queue q.

I have four questions:

1. When calling fold2 on (fun x _ –&gt; enq x q) ( ) q where q is the queue generated from [1; 2; 3; 4], what exactly is ""x"" in ""fun x _ "" and what is the wildcard in ""_"" ""fun x _""?
2. When we begin pattern matching qno, are we starting with the node that contains the value 1?
If so, when we go to ""Some qn –&gt; loop qn.next (combine qn.v acc)""... is qn.next called ""qno"" and ""(combine qn.v acc)"" called ""acc""?
3. In this case, we would loop to the node that contains the value 2. But where in this statement have we actually enqueued the node that contained the value 1 onto the queue q?
4. Why is 5.b never-ending?

	Could the solution have been written the following ways?

fold (fun x acc -&gt; if x &gt; acc then Some x else acc) l None 

	If we are doing tail recursion, does it matter if the code is
loop n.next (acc+1)
versus
loop n.next (1+acc)
is one of these not tail recursive?	I don't understand why you need to do List.rev acc for the then statement"

"	Is there any way to print the tail of a particular branch in a pattern match? For my case it is recursive so I can just print the input var on every pass but I cannot print anything from inside a function.

The variable in question is a list. It seems pretty trivial to convert a list to a string by using join. How do we then print that String within that function?

I have tried

;;print_endline 

and

;;print_string 
but somehow I cannot use these inside a function.	I am working on Problem 7 and I feel as though I have written code that should work, but it isn't passing the tests. I am also not sure how to use the print function to see what the output actually is and narrow down the issue. So I guess my question is twofold -- 1. Is there a logical error in my code that I just am not seeing? and 2. how do I use the print command to show me what the output is right now? 	Before submitting, should I be deleting the print statements I write and use for debugging?	Should we delete the print statements that were given to us?	Is there any way to print the list?	should we use the print function?	How can I use the print function to print out my queue for debugging? I'm not sure what to put in as the string_of_element argument.	Is there any way to print out queues to debug code? 	Should we be using print statements then to display possible word corrections/changes to the user?	So I am having the same problem as @3440 where it passes all the tests but prints invalid a bunch of times, but my printout also doesn't print all the options (like it never prints the corrections suggestions), even though I am taking care of this when I print... I tried moving my print stuff around but it didn't change anything. Is there anything else that comes to mind for a fix?	It does print within the flagged method every time I right clicked as well. 	
Why does the third question of just ""2"" throw a NullPointerException? How can line be null?
I got that it would print 2, 2 and Done!. Wouldn't line be 2, then 2 would be added to numbers. Then it would break out of the while loop and print line.toCharArray which is 2? And then then it would close and print numbers (2) again and then print ""Done!"".

"	I am getting a ""make: Nothing to be done for `all'"" when building paint ever since implementing my slider function. I looked through everything and really can't find what's wrong with my slider function. Here is what I added to widget for slider (and I did update widget.mli):

          in   
       canvas (width,9) repaint_slider in 
  
  let slider, nc = slider_builder (vc.get_value()) w c in 
   nc.add_event_listener (slider_listener vc); 
      
  let bordered = border slider in 
  bordered, vc
Here is what I added to paint: 
let w_rslider, vc_rslider = slider 0 255 red 

;; vc_rslider.add_change_listener (fun v -&gt; paint.color &lt;- {r = v; g = paint.color.g; b = paint.color.b} )

I have an error that showed up when I switched from a black fill_rect to red, green, and blue filled rectangles for my sliders. The lines around each of the rectangles have turned seemingly random colors.  Where is this bug coming from all of a sudden?
Here is my code for slider:
let slider (pos: int) (c: Gctx.color) : widget * int value_controller =
  let new_control : int value_controller = make_control pos in
  let width, height = (255, 10) in
  { repaint = (fun (g: Gctx.gctx) -&gt; 
        Gctx.draw_rect g (0, 10) (width, height); 
        Gctx.fill_rect (Gctx.with_color g c) (0, 10) (new_control.get_value(), height));
    handle = (fun (g: Gctx.gctx) (e: Gctx.event) -&gt; 
    if (fst e == Gctx.MouseDown || fst e == Gctx.MouseDrag)
    then (if (fst (Gctx.event_pos e g) &lt; 0) then new_control.change_value 0
          else if (fst (Gctx.event_pos e g) &gt; 255) then new_control.change_value 255
          else new_control.change_value (fst (Gctx.event_pos e g))));
    size = (fun () -&gt; (width, height))}, new_control
And here is my code in paint.ml:
let (rslide_w, rslide_vc) = slider 0 (red)

let mk_listener_rslide (i: int) : unit =
  paint.color &lt;- {r = i; g = paint.color.g; b = paint.color.b}

;; rslide_vc.add_change_listener (mk_listener_rslide)

let (gslide_w, gslide_vc) = slider 0 (green)

let mk_listener_gslide (i: int) : unit =
  paint.color &lt;- {r = paint.color.r; g = i; b = paint.color.b}

Hi, I understand that x's static type is Object, but does that mean that we also don't know the dynamic type of x (which I think is String?)?

This is the to_list in the lecture notes. Why do we have to reverse the list at the end?

"	Also, when I implement preview, the line flickers while I drag it: is this normal?	I updated undo for preview (I'm in task 2), but when I update repaint for preview and then try to draw a line, the preview is drawn as two lines very close together. When I don't update preview, everything seems to be functioning fine. Why exactly do I need to update repaint for preview if the preview feature works fine without the update to repaint?	I am having trouble implementing the line preview in task 2 - the preview line is always black, and switched to the proper color after I move my mouse away. My code should be drawing the preview line with the color in the graphics context. In general, are there any pieces of this I am missing?	I am able to draw points in point mode every time I click, but I cant make a continuous stream of points when I drag the mouse. 

I understand that this is because I am SETTING paint.preview to be a given point instead of ADDING the point to paint.preview. But I don't understand how to ADD a point to paint.preview in MouseDrag.	I set my preview to some line like this

paint.preview &lt;- Some (Line (paint.color, p1, p)

but I am getting an error that I do not understand. 	What should a preview line look like?	When the user is in PointMode and drags the mouse, a trail of points show up because of preview, but when the user releases the mouse button are those preview points supposed to remain, or are they supposed to disappear and the only point left that's actually added to deque is the last point (where their mouse is released?)	Should we write another version of preview inside widget to implement slider? 	When we drag the mouse, should we be updating in place paint.preview so that the point list field in Points type is changed, or should we be adding a completely new points option to paint.preview?	I thought I could pattern match on paint.preview since I wanted to get the point list and insert them to the dequeue	In Task 3, are we supposed to be updating: 

let paint : state = {mutable mode: ...mutable color: ...mutable preview: ......}  

and

type state = {shape =...mode =...color = ...preview = ......}

for PointMode? The directions in Codio imply that we are, but there's no explicit reference to this in the instructions	after going through all of the steps of preview i get an error with ""let paint : state"" that says
Some record fields are undefined: preview	
Did we also have to adjust paint to include preview in some way?	Kind of confused about the syntax; I'm told that I have a syntax error, but I thought this code would be executable since I have iterated through everything in the history, and only if the preview is not none, I want to use the draw_shape to paint another line. 	It's a unit, but if I add ;; at the end of Deque.iterate draw_shape paint.shapes, it makes the next line afterwards unbound value. Is there a way for me to reiterate afterwards?

And since I am only adding after the line in task 2, it would only have lines (and paint.preview has the right format). 	I am getting unclosed brackets error in this line  paint.preview &lt;- Some (Points paint.color (p::ps)). I have other lines with same thing that don't have error, what could be wrong with this? 	To preview how much the slider is filled in while it is being dragged, I wanted to add a rectangle to paint.preview.  Obviously I cannot reference paint in my generic widget, so how do I make a preview similar to the ellipse or line preview?	Is it normal that the buttons in the preview of Pennstagram don't work? Even though the tests have passed. Thank you."
"	I tried to get the minimum int in a list of ints by writing this function:

let rec simplest_hamming (i: int list) int = begin match i with |[] -&gt; 0 |x::xs -&gt; min x (simplest_hamming xs) end

however, it's giving me the error ""This expression has type a' -&gt; int, but an expression was expected of type int"". I don't quite understand the problem with the code nor the error statement. 	I wrote two helper functions that both return int, but when I try to compare the
outputs of the two functions, Codio says I need a type int and not a type int -&gt; int.
Is there any easy way to fix this?	let make_incr (n:int) : int-&gt;int =
  let helper (x:int) : int = n + x in
  helper 
For make_incr 3, IO'm wondering why the return type would be int -&gt; int.

It simplifies to fun(x: int) -&gt; x+3, but why is it int -&gt; int (I guess because the function itself is an int value and x+3 is also an int value?) but why isn't it (int -&gt; int) -&gt; int? (since fun(x) takes in an int and returns an int?) How should I think about the -&gt;? 	Thank you for the prompt response! But I guess I am confused about anonymous functions then. Isn't the type of fun x int-&gt; int in this case? Or is it just saying that it is a function that takes in x as an input value? So for instance,

let add_one (x:int) : int = x+1let add_one : int-&gt;int = fun (x:int) -&gt; x+1
I don't quite get this definition :( 	On the immutable records slide, there are semicolons after every record component, including the last one

Ex. type rgb = {r:int; g:int; b:int;}

However, it's not used in the last slide on OCaml Record Syntax

Ex. let f {r ; g} = r + g
or
let mk_rgb (r:int) (g:int) (b:int) = {r; g; b}


When is it appropriate to add semicolons after the last record component and when is it not?

Thanks!	Is there a difference between (int -&gt; int) -&gt; int and int -&gt; (int -&gt; int)? Why is sum int -&gt; (int -&gt; int)?	Why is it that int -&gt; int -&gt; int is equivalent to int -&gt; (int -&gt; int) but not (int -&gt; int) -&gt; int? I understand it has to do with using a function as an input for (int -&gt; int) -&gt; int, but isn't int -&gt; (int -&gt; int) also different just with the function as an output?	let l: ('int -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a = fun x -&gt; x 42

Can you check if my reasoning is right?
So x is a function that takes in 42, 
so the first input is int
we know x is a 'a 
so the second input is 'a
so the full input is (int -&gt; 'a)
then the function returns x so the type of l is (int -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a
------------------------
I am also a bit confused as to why the type isn't (int-&gt;int)-&gt;int if x takes in 42 which is an int???	So int is an input of x 'a is an output of x and 'a is the output of the whole function right??	if there was a problem 
let x = 10 in fun (y: int) -&gt; x

Is the type int -&gt; int? If so, why isn't it simply int since you know the function will always return x which is an int? 
	let f : ___ ’a -&gt; int __________ = (fun x -&gt; fun y -&gt; x) 42
Why is this 'a -&gt; int rather than just int? Wouldn't this always be equal to 42?	This is what I wrote:
let rec helper (lst1:int list) (lst2:int list) : int list =  begin match lst1, lst2 with  | [],[]-&gt;[]  | [], _ -&gt; lst2  | _,[] -&gt; lst1  | hd1::tl1, hd2::tl2 -&gt; (hd1+hd2)::helper tl1 tl2  end
let rec level_sum (t: int tree) : int list =  begin match t with  | Empty -&gt; []  | Node (lt,x,rt) -&gt; x::helper(level_sum lt)(level_sum rt)
Would this still work? I saw in the answer key that for the helper function, the first match case I wrote isn't present.

Here's the answer:
	But why would I not? Isn't modifying the params with
(with_params g c)
necessary to set color, coordinates and the like?
Additionally I tried getting rid of that part and now have ""expression is int -&gt; int -&gt; unit instead of unit"".
	Is there anyway for ocaml to give me only ""int"" (and not ""unit -&gt; int"") when I call 'a value_controller.get_value()? 	Is it possible to directly return an array in a method? For example

	I'm adding in all the pixels but I'm not sure what to put as the int value for put()- my instinct is numColors but only because that's the only other int I can think of?	When returning an int (the red value of a pixel, for example), do we have to copy it into a new int to return it? Or since it's primitive and lives on the stack, we can just return the value of red itself/	Can someone tell me why all of my error messages say ""The method assertEquals(int, int) is undefined for the type MyPixelTest""? Thanks!
	Does this include primitive types as well? (e.g. int, boolean) 	So most of what the method extent is supposed to do happens in set. I see that it returns the value of the private int extent but how do we compute it. 

Also what is this line supposed to do in set method? 
int[] newdata = new int[Math.max(idx+1, data.length*2)]

	If in ocaml

a: int = 99b: int = al1: int list = [a]val c : int ref = {contents = 0}
begin match l1 with|[x] -&gt; c.contents &lt;- x
Would b be referential equal to c?

	I understand that Integer is a wrapper class for the primitive int. If we want to do any operations on an int, we use Integer.method() and not int.method(). But what does that actually mean?I have this question in context of why this
TreeMap&lt;int, String&gt; somemap
does not compile, but this
TreeMap&lt;Integer, String&gt; somemap
does?	If you were to initialize an array as follows:
int [ ] a = new int [ 4 ];
then what would a [ 3 ] contain? would it be null or 0?	int[][] arr = new int[5][];int[] shared = new int[10];for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i ++){   arr[i] = shared;}
Why won't this work? Doesn't it just make a 5 * 10 matrix?
(From textbook page 218)	What if in the method we use ""this?"" As in, if we write
public int getX () {
return this.x;
}
for a Point with int fields x, y?	For example, if you were to have this in OCaml:

let  x = 3
let  y = x

or this in Java:

int x = 3;
int y = x;

would they be aliases just like objects would?	for this line of code 
if (c.getOwner() == userId)
I'm getting a message ""Incompatible operand types String and int."" In this case, userId is a parameter int and c is a Channel object, where the getOwner() method is defined as
public int getOwner() {
	return this.owner;
}
I'm confused why the compiler thinks I'm comparing a String and int?	The method isWordCharacter starts as follows: 

public static boolean isWordCharacter(int c) {    return false; }

Why does using an int here work? 	I’m a little confused about functions like isWordcharacter(int c), where we use an int value to check the status of a character. What exactly is this int value? Is it an ASCII representation of a character? Can we simply cast to a char in order to use the isLetter method from the character class? Just trying to understand what’s going on here, thanks so much.  	If we were to input something like 'a' into TokenScanner.isWordCharacter(int c), would this throw an IllegalArgumentException or would the method just automatically cast the char to an int?	I get an error message saying that getCorrectBombs() is undefined for the type new MouseAdapter() 

Where should I be placing it then? I want to update the number of correctBombs s.t. when all bombs have been identified in MineSweeper, I can have the game be won,

		addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {	
			public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {

				int x = e.getX();
				int y = e.getY();
				int i = (int) (x/4.0);
				int j = (int) (640 - y/4.0);
				
				if (SwingUtilities.isLeftMouseButton(e)) {	
					if (grid[i][j].isBomb()) {
							grid[i][j].press();
					}
					else {
						int zero = ((Numbered) grid[i][j]).getNumber();
						if (zero == 0) {
							//for all the grids if it is not a bomb, it would ""press""
						}
					}
				}
				else if (SwingUtilities.isRightMouseButton(e)) {
					boolean change = grid[i][j].pressFlag();
					if (grid[i][j].isBomb()) {
						setCorrectBombs(this.getCorrectBombs() - 1);
						
					}
				}
			}

"	I am getting this error on the following line. I have no idea why....

Set&lt;String&gt; corrections = TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();"
"	I am working on a recursive function for clearing away non-mine blocks when the user clicks on a block that has no adjacent mines. I've been having a lot of trouble getting this function to work correctly. I know I could probably make the if statements more efficient, but really what I'm wondering is if anyone can spot where my logic went wrong. 

Right now the function sort of works--like if I click a block with no adjacent mines, it will open up new areas, but I think it goes too far. Like if there is a long chain of diagonal zero blocks, it will only open those but not their neighbors, but then it also opens some of the blocks that actually display numbers.

I know the for-loops are correct in how they access each block, so it must be something with either my recursive logic, or simply inefficiency.

When I make the first click (which initializes all the blocks as either bombs or safe blocks, I get this printout: 
Exception in thread ""AWT-EventQueue-0"" java.lang.StackOverflowError
at GameCourt.clearBlocks(GameCourt.java:139)
at GameCourt.clearBlocks(GameCourt.java:146)
So I assume, I'm doing some kind of infinite/overflow thing. Line 146 is where the recursive call is made. Line 139 is the first if statement inside the function, so I don't know what that is about. 

Any advice on this would be appreciated!! Also, the function uncover() simply changes a field on the block which then dictates how the block is painted in the view portion of the game.

   private void clearBlocks(Block b) {
    	if (!b.isBomb() &amp;&amp; b.getNumBombs() == 0) {
    		for (int i = Math.max(0, b.getX() / 30 - 1); i &lt;= Math.min(this.mineField.length - 1, b.getX() / 30 + 1); i++) {
    			for (int j = Math.max(0, b.getY() / 30 - 1); j &lt;= Math.min(this.mineField.length - 1, b.getY() / 30 + 1); j++) {
    				b.uncover();
    				this.uncovered--;
    				clearBlocks(this.mineField[i[[j]);
    			}
    		}
    	} else if (!b.isBomb() &amp;&amp; b.getNumBombs() &gt; 0) {
    		b.uncover();
    		this.uncovered--;
    	} else {
    		return;
    	}
    }
	I'm coding minesweeper, and I got to the point where I was almost done before I realized that my inheritance is not enough to satisfy the requirement. I had initially planned on handling how different types of blocks--safe and bomb--were uncovered differently via a recursive uncovering function, but I ended up implementing that in my minefield class (which is just a 2d array of blocks). The recursive function works properly in the minefield class, but I'm trying to redo it in the safe block class so that I will have a different behavior for safe blocks and bombs. I feel like the logic should hold, but when I try to implement it this way, it messes up in a lot of ways. 

This is the code that I have for the function in the safe block class:
public int sweepUncovered(Block[][] mineField) {
	int numUncovered = 0;
	if (!this.isBomb()) {
    		if (this.isClicked) {
    			return 0;
    		} else if (this.getNumBombs() == 0) {
    			for (int i = Math.max(0, this.getX() / 30 - 1); i &lt;= Math.min(mineField.length - 1, this.getX() / 30 + 1); i++) {
        			for (int j = Math.max(0, this.getY() / 30 - 1); j &lt;= Math.min(mineField.length - 1, this.getY() / 30 + 1); j++) {
        				this.uncover();
        				numUncovered++;
        				mineField[i][j].sweepUncovered(mineField);
        			}
        		}
    		} else if (this.getNumBombs() &gt; 0) {
    			this.uncover();
        		numUncovered++;
    		} else {
    			return 0;
    		}
    	}
		return numUncovered;
}

This is the code for the other function I have that works properly:
private void clearBlocks(Block b) {
    	if (!b.isBomb()) {
    		if (b.isClicked) {
    			return;
    		} else if (b.getNumBombs() == 0) {
    			for (int i = Math.max(0, b.getX() / 30 - 1); i &lt;= Math.min(this.mineField.length - 1, b.getX() / 30 + 1); i++) {
        			for (int j = Math.max(0, b.getY() / 30 - 1); j &lt;= Math.min(this.mineField.length - 1, b.getY() / 30 + 1); j++) {
        				b.uncover();
        				this.uncovered--;
        				clearBlocks(this.mineField[i][j]);
        			}
        		}
    		} else if (b.getNumBombs() &gt; 0) {
    			b.uncover();
        		this.uncovered--;
    		} else {
    			return;
    		}
    	}
    }

I feel like this function is the only way that I can really successfully do inheritance with minesweeper, so if there are any glaring differences you can see between the two functions, I'd appreciate a pointer? Are there any other ways I could successfully do inheritance without using this function? All my other functions that are different between the two classes are drawing functions (but there are more than one drawing function for each class). I really don't want to have to start coding a different game at this point, since I was so close to being done with this one, so hopefully there is a way to make it work. I'd try to figure out something with collections, but I'm using 2D arrays so I can't... 
	I changed my function back to what I had before, but now it isn't working. I don't know why because it is the same function as before, and I changed everything back. This is what it looks like...

Is there anything that seems out of place? If not, I'll prob go to office hours.
Thanks

private void clearBlocks(Block b) {
		if (b.isClicked) {
			return;
		} else if (b.getNumBombs() == 0 &amp;&amp; !b.isBomb) {
			for (int i = Math.max(0, b.getX() / 30 - 1); i &lt;= Math.min(
					this.mineField.length - 1, b.getX() / 30 + 1); i++) {
    			for (int j = Math.max(0, b.getY() / 30 - 1); j &lt;= Math.min(
    					this.mineField.length - 1, b.getY() / 30 + 1); j++) {
    				b.uncover();
    				this.covered--;
    				clearBlocks(this.mineField[i][j]);
    			}
    		}
		} else if (b.getNumBombs() &gt; 0) {
			b.uncover();
    		this.covered--;
		} else {
			return;
		}

I wrote my truncate function and when I run it, the test fails before ever reaching truncate, with an error: ""truncate 4-elements reported 'to_list: given invalid queue'. Why is this error happening? Why is my test case not passing valid?

    q.data &lt;- fold (fun v acc -&gt; if v = elt then v else acc) [] q.data
	  let truncate (elt: 'a) (q: 'a queue) : unit =
    if not (valid q) then failwith ""truncate: given invalid queue"";
    let rec loop (no: 'a qnode option) : unit =
      begin match no with
      | None -&gt; () 
      | Some n -&gt; 
        if n.v == elt then n.next &lt;- None; 
        q.tail &lt;- Some n;
        else loop n.next
      end
    in loop q.head
The if then else part of my pattern matching is returning an error.. it says that the begin is not closed. How would I fix this? 	Hi, 

I would really appreciate any feedback with my linkedqueue delete because it seems as though I have covered all necessary cases, yet the function still only works for one of my cases. 

this is the code

let delete (elt: 'a) (q: 'a queue) : unit = if not (valid q) then failwith ""delete: given invalid queue""; let rec loop (qn: 'a qnode option) (elt1: 'a) : unit =  begin match qn with  | None -&gt; () | Some n -&gt;  begin match n.next with  | None -&gt; () | Some m -&gt; if q.head == Some n &amp;&amp; n.v = elt1 then q.head &lt;- Some m else if  q.tail == Some m &amp;&amp; m.v == elt1 then q.tail &lt;- Some n else if m.v = elt1  then n.next &lt;- m.next else loop m.next elt1 end end in  loop q.head elt

"	Thank you! For this question, do we have to account for the instance where the list is empty?	Chapter 3 of the OCaml manual refers to the ""suffix"" of a list but I'm not quite clear on what this means? It looks like it has a more subtle meaning than simply the end of a list, but I can't quite figure it out.	Ok so could we equivalently say that for the list [1; 2; 3; 4], that its suffix could also be [2; 3; 4], in addition to [3;4], or [4]? Also, the book includes both the whole list and the empty list [ ] as a suffix. Why is it that we can include those two?	For question 6 is the empty list [] a valid input for l (the string list)? If so, would it just evaluate to """"? Thanks!	For the join function, I am trying to handle the general recursive situation, the case of an empty list, and the case of the last item in the list (using """" as the separator) with pattern matching, but when I try to do this it keeps saying that I'm trying to append two empty lists. I know this is probably because I'm handling the second to last case and the last case and I probably only need to be handling two total cases, but I can't seem to figure this out. I was thinking of using an if statement in the general recursive part of the function, but I'm not really sure how to implement that in this instance.	For the pattern matching that I am using in the join function, I have the recursive call for the main case figured out, and I have the base case (empty list) figured out, but for the case of the last element in the list (which I do not want to be followed by a separator) I tried concatenating the term with the join function of """" and the remaining empty list, and I get the above error statement. I have tried all different outputs as well as if-then statements, but I feel like my code is on the right track, I just need to denote that the empty string I want to join for the last element in the list is the ""tail"" or the bade case not just some random empty list that I'm introducing. 

Does anyone have any suggestions that might help with this?	Is there a way to go back to the beginning of an original list once you have already iterated through it using pattern match and hit the []?  I am trying to find a way to go through the whole list and then start again from the top.

I'm a little confused by the invariance on sets. In problem 6 it states: "" NOTE: We are going to maintain the additional invariants that this list is sorted in ascending order, and contains no duplicates."" Is this referring to the ""output"" of our functions or the sets themselves?

If so, then why are there explicit instructions for list_of_set in setInterface: ""This list should be sorted in ascending order and may not contain duplicate elements""? Is this just to reiterate and remind us? 

Thanks!	I tried using exist and filter. Are those not the ones I should be using? I'm just stuck on how to order the list if we go through the elements one by one.

Do we need to write tests for the functions we implement at the end of the question 4?

Additionally, does the list input for tree_of_list come sorted? I saw the previous answer about this, but it is possible to produce multiple different BSTs from the same list? Or does the order of the elements in the tree not matter; is the only thing that matters that the tree follows the invariants?	The description for the add function include this bit: ""Remember, we're maintaining the invariants that this list is sorted and contains no duplicate elements."" When it states ""this list"", are you referring to the input or the output? In other words, is the list that is being pattern matched already sorted and contains no duplicate elements, or do we have to write the add function in a way that the output is sorted and contains no duplicates?	For the key question, what should the function return if an empty list is passed onto it? 	Because multiple BSTs can be made from a given list, depending on the order in which elements are added, is it okay if we write separate tests for set_of_list OLSet and set_of_list BSTSet? OLSet will only give one ordered list for a given list, while BSTSet could return a variety of tree structures.	I'm having trouble implementing count_words_in_text.

For the set_of_list function, should the function fail if the list passed to it doesn't follow the invariants, or should it correct the list and then make it into a set?	The function is returning a bool, so should the base case not be false, in that none of the elements in the list satisfy the predicate?	Why is list_of_set in treeSet recursive when it appears that you can just call inorder s and the tree will be returned as a list?

Am I missing anything?	Under implementing the list add function, it says:
Remember, we're maintaining the invariants that this list is sorted and contains no duplicate elements.
I'm not sure what it means ""this list is sorted""
Does that mean implementing the add function should also sort the list after adding?	let rec transform (f: 'a -&gt; 'b) (l: 'a list) : 'b list =

	When converting from list to linkedQueue, should the tail.v be the last element in the list? 	does cat_option return every single value including the repeated values or just the discrete values? like if the input includes 1, 1, 2 would the returned list include 1, 1, 2 or just 1, 2?	I'm a little confused as to how we're supposed to return a unit for iter? I am doing the usual pattern matching through the list, but don't quite understand what kind of value it's looking for...I looked at the similar question someone asked about this problem, but I don't understand the explanation	The function definition seemed alright to me but since it was still giving me an error, I decided to try doing the problem without the helper. I guess the main reason why I was trying to use a helper was because i could not understand how to return a unit type from the pattern matching. I read through the FAQs and saw that we need to put the commands in brackets with ; if we have conditional statements but what about the base case which does not have any conditionals? Also when we recurse over q.data (this is in reference to the truncate function) isn't q.data technically being changed on every recursion? Is is better to declare a temporary list, recurse on that list and then update the value of q.data? Initially I tried to do the recursion over a temporary variable in the helper function but now I am trying to recurse over q.data directly	I was thinking of rewriting List.length to find the size, but if I can't do that then I can try to think of something else. Thanks!	I read that post, but I was still rather confused. At first I thought to use transform, but that returns a unit list. Then, I considered implementing some sort of pattern matching, but I could not get past the obstacle of changing the list values before returning unit. 	For the truncate function, should the element we are matching on also be removed from the truncated list or only everything after it should be removed?	Why do we reverse the list in the implementation of to_list in linkedQueue? If we just keep following the next pointers shouldn't we get the list in order?	When pattern matching against Some, couldn't you just say n.v :: (loop n.next) and get rid of the 'a list argument in loop? That would return the list in order so you wouldn't have to reverse it right?	Why does the to_list function for linkedQueue have List.rev included when pattern matching against None? Wouldn't you just return [ ] to end the function?	I am getting an infinite loop in my code and I can't figure out where. I checked the FAQ and still can't figure it out:

let from_list (l: 'a list) : 'a queue =  let q = create () in  let rec create_list (data: 'a list) : unit =     begin match l with     |[] -&gt; ()    |x::rest -&gt; (enq x q; create_list rest)    end   in   create_list l;   q
	This is a question in the homework and I'm not actually sure. I completed the function without using the hint but am curious about why List operations are needed? 	for cat_option I'm trying to say if the head of the 'a option list is Some a then to just return a but it says that a is an unbound value. why is this happening? I also tried wildcarding but that didn't work either	When creating truncate, are we essentially creating a new list and replacing q.data with that new list since its a mutable data type? Or are we just changing q.data in place by changing the references inside the actual list itself.	We can use List.rev in linkedqueue correct? 	cons takes in a value and the next element of the list? am I supposed to pattern match?	I implemented iter using pattern matching, but just out of curiosity, is it even possible to do it with higher order functions fold and transform? (Since they return a list). Or, is there such thing as a list of units? (if there is, is it just like, ""nothing?"") 	This question says we can't use any list library functions, but can we seperately reverse the list using a function we define ourselves and then process it?	Oops sorry, I will next time. I’m confused as to how you would approach that. Would you find the length of each list and set the longer list to be l1? 	
In the bottom part where the answer key is for the implementation of less_than, shouldn't the Empty be []?
Since we are within the module implementation, we can assume the 'a set we're passed in is a list, meaning we can pattern match on list characteristics (i.e. the second branch is h :: t which contradicts the first branch currently)	Just to make sure, does this transform actually produce an 'a list list? It's like, take in every 'a element in the list and transform them into a 'a list. So the result is a 'a list list? If not what does it produce? 	[] :: [] :: [] Why can this typecheck ?

Since [4]::[3] is absolutely wrong is the empty list an exception?	since i think [] can be 'a list	In the instructions, it tells us to use the fold_right function. Would we be using this along with anon. function? or can we just call list.fold_right on the list_layout arguments?	This is similar to the post in @1434 but I do not understand how/where 'a value_controller stores a value and its list of change_listeners. Is 'a value_controller a record of three specific functions (as the instructions say) or does it contain a list of functions and a certain value...it seems to do both but how? 

Also,""Think carefully about what state needs to be stored with each instance of a value_controller returned by make_control"" What does state mean in this context? Does it refer to the type state of paint.ml (shape, mode, color etc.)? 

Thanks!
	I am currently coding the add_change_listener in make_control and I am try to update the list of change listeners by consing on the new element in the mutable record I used to store the change listeners. Codio says it won't typecheck since it's returning a list, but I'm trying to update the mutable contents of the record (which is a list) with an updated list. Shouldn't that return unit? Why doesn't this type check? 	Really? I just called list_layout passing hpair/vpair and the list ws as an argument and it passed the tests	Do we need to define a type change_listener? I'm confused as to how value_controller can store a list of something that isn't defined.	I tried using bool list and string list as inputs, giving out a tuple output in widget.ml which didn't give any errors. However, when instantiating radio_button in paint.ml, it keeps throwing out pattern matching not exhaustive when I'm using the same concept as instantiating a button.	If a 'a value controller is composed only of references to functions, I am a little confused as to where i can store my list of change_listeners and my 'a value if not in the value_controller itself.  	Ah, I see that all I'm doing is iterating through the list with the new value without actually changing the old value. I'm still confused on how to set the new value as the new argument	so can I make radio button grouop as a list of widgets?	I did not do List.add_change_listener, but just add_change_listener in the make_controller function. 

That's why I don't understand the error too.	It should be 'a-&gt;unit list right because the list should contain change_listeners. I initiate the contents of my ref as an empty list but I add to it in add_change_listener.	for handling MouseDrag in PointMode, I want to add on the new points to the points list that was created from the code we were given to be put back into paint.preview. I can only think to append the list with the new point at the front of the list (just by nature of hd::tl) but I think the order would be messed up?	I'm on the last step of the radio buttons and am trying to add the checkboxes to the toolbar. Since my buttons are currently stored in a widget list, can I just use the List.nth function to access the widgets and score them into their appropriate places?	More specifically:  would it be possible to group them together by creating a list that we get from pattern matching off an int (representing the button number)? 	I'm a little confused for dequeues about why the version of to_list where the value is cons onto the front of the list is better than the version where the list is appended to the value. How does the first one avoid building up the stack more than the second? It seems to me like in both cases the list is ready to be constructed by the time loop is recursively called.	Was just confused about how this function ""just hangs"" and what exactly is meant by that. Also, why is ""elements"" returned when you match with an empty list. Say I called count_elements [] 8 it seems that this function would return 8 (because it would match with empty list). 	Thanks for your help--- just to clarify: this means you would have to visualize the list using Cons when drawing it on the ASM? 

Meaning if the list was x = [3] it would look like this:

	
Since the key doesn't mention it, is the type that works here an int list ref? 
Also, the x in fun doesn't have anything to do with the ref x, right? 	so in this case, can 'a refer to a 'a list or are we just assuming that a type 'a list ref exists since 'a ref exists?	Is there a function that lets me get the key (or list of keys) that are paired with a given value in a TreeMap? I know the get function allows me to do the reverse.	I don't see the remove method in the documentation for collections (Only linked list etc.)	I am storing HighScore objects in a LinkedList. I'm trying to find an appropriate interface to be the static type - I can't use Deque because then the sort method doesn't work and eclipse won't let me use List because 
The type List is not generic; it cannot be parameterized with arguments &lt;HighScore&gt;. Would it be acceptable, in this case, to use LinkedList as the static type?
	but remove last also ""Removes and returns the last element from this list."" which I also need to do

	Do you have a suggestion for somehow storing a 2D array in a linked list otherwise?	Hi! I'm writing JUnit tests and realized that my getSnake() function (which just returns my snake linked list) isn't preserving encapsulation for some reason. The assertFalse below fails. When I get the linked list, then move the snake, then compare the original tail to the new tail, it appears that the linked list that getSnake() returned also moved its position. Super confused why, since I'm copying over each body part to a new linked list and returning that. Appreciate the help in understanding my issue!


	I'm having a problem with adding/removing elements in a linkedlist.

Something like this is going on:
Linkedlist list has elements [a,b,c,d] (checked with a System.out.print).
list.add(e);
Linkedlist list now has elements [a,d,c,d,e] (checked with a System.out.print).

What is going on? Why is it that the 2nd element element always gets replaced with an added element?	Well, more specifically, this is when the problem occurs:

Say list = [a,b,c].
I do:
-&gt;list.removeLast();
at this point, list should theoretically be [a,b], which it is (I checked using print statements).
Then I do:
-&gt;list.add(c);
But now, using print statements I see that list = [a,c,c].
Somehow, adding the element back caused previous elements in the list to change. Is this a problem with the ASM or something? Also, a,b, and c are of type String[][].	The instructions tells us to use List = new LinkedList instead of LinkedList = new LinkedList.
How do we use methods like ""removelast"" (something from LinkedList) if we initialize with List = new LinkedList?	What is the point of having Deque implement list? 
Would Iterator work if DequeIterator wasn't implemented?

"	Can we also use this for enq (in SimpleQueue)?	do you need to use enq for this	I modified my code to this

I thought that enq added a new element at the end of q each time it's called, and deq removes the head of q each time it's called. 
Therefore since the code is enq 2 then enq 1 we have a q with q.head is the 2 and then we remove the head and end up with a q that is just 1
Isn't that D?"

Also if we have a empty dictionary what should be returned when we check for an existence of a word?

	SwapCorrector says that if the provided word is already spelled correctly, then the empty set should be returned. 

However, could there be a case where both the input word and the swapped word are both in the dictionary?
I.e. Dear and Dera (although dera isn't a word).

If so, would we still return an empty set?"

"	Having a little issue with signature mismatch in truncate for simpleQueue but not sure where my error is. I used an inner recursive function to help, code is below:

        end 
    in loop elt q
I am confused logically in how I would deal with the recursive call in my else statement ""loop elt tl"" because it's of type 'a list when it should be type 'a queue. I have tried to work around it with this code:

let truncate (elt: 'a) (q: 'a queue) : unit =
    let rec loop (elt: 'a) (q: 'a list) : unit = 
        begin match q with 
        | [] -&gt; ()
        | hd::tl -&gt; if hd == elt then q &lt;- [hd] else loop elt tl
        end 
    in loop elt q.data
but codio gives the error that q is not an instance variable...	when you say operator are you referring to the arrow in q.data &lt;- [hd]? I used that same notation in enq so I thought it would be okay here. I think I'm trying to get the loop to modify q.data and I think I don't need it to be 'a queue...

let truncate (elt: 'a) (q: 'a queue) : unit =
    let rec loop (elt: 'a) (q: 'a queue) : unit = 
        begin match q.data with

        end 
    in loop elt q
I've modified it because I realized I was missing stuff in my else statement but I come into the same trouble with tl. Is it possible to return that part of the queue or would I have to change the input type of the recursive function?	I'm sort of stuck with how to proceed with delete for LinkedQueue. Do we create  if else statements for the three cases stated or do we pattern match on curr.next with an inner recursive function? What sort of other helper function would I need... just kinda stuck overall:

    private Set&lt;User&gt; registeredUsers; 
    private Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; nicknameIDMatch; 
    private Map&lt;String, Channel&gt; currentChannels;
Hello! So I have a Channel class and a user class, and as above I store the currently registered users as a treeset, a map between the userID and the nickname, and a map between the Channel name and the Channel. I am also storing the users connected to the Channel inside the Channel class as a treeset. As a result, I ended up with this when implementing the getUsersInChannel: 

    public Collection&lt;String&gt; getUsersInChannel(String channelName) {
        Collection&lt;String&gt; usersInChannel = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();
        if (currentChannels.containsKey(channelName)) {
            Collection&lt;User&gt; a = currentChannels.get(channelName).getChannelUsers();
            for (User u: a) {
                usersInChannel.add(nicknameIDMatch.get(u.getUserID())); 
            }
        }    
        return usersInChannel; 
    }
Which works, but is pretty absurd (in my opinion but lmk if it's not!). The complication I am running into is because I am trying to get the Channel Object (through the channel name), get the channel's users, and get the user's nickname by getting the user's ID. Should I change my implementation at this point? More specifically, I am considering making a map of nicknames and users but it seems redundant since I already have a set of current users and an ID mapping of the nicknames. Any advice on the design would be mucho appreciated (cry) 	Hello,

I've been working on getting a channel to create for the past few days now and I don't seem to be making any headway as to why I'm getting a Null Pointer Exception. :( I was wondering if it might be possible for someone to steer me in the right direction. 

I start off by making a Map for Channels in ServerModel.java:
 private Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; registeredUsers;
 private Map&lt;String, Channel&gt; channelList;

 public ServerModel() {
  registeredUsers = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;(); //Initializing our map of registered users
  channelList = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;();
 }
 

And then, I create a Channel:
    public void createChannel(String channelName, String owner)
    {
     Channel c = new Channel (owner);
     channelList.put(channelName, c);
     c.addUserChannel(owner);
    }

Moving on to the Channel class itself, here's what I have for the file:
import java.util.*;

public final class Channel {
 private Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; usersList;
 private Set&lt;String&gt; usersInChannelList;
 private String owner;

 public Channel(String owner) {
  usersList = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;(); //Initializing our map of users in a specific channel
  this.owner = owner;
 }

 public String getOwner()
 {
  return this.owner;
 }


 public void addUserChannel(String nickname)
 {
  usersInChannelList.add(nickname);
 }


 public void removeUserChannel(String nickname)
 {  
  usersInChannelList.remove(nickname);
 }

 public Set&lt;String&gt; getUsersInChannel()
 {
  return usersInChannelList;
 }

}



And my CreateChannel command in Command.java:
/**
 * Represents a {@link Command} issued by a client to create a new channel.
 */
class CreateCommand extends Command {
    private String channel;
    private boolean inviteOnly;

    public CreateCommand(int senderId, String sender, String channel, boolean inviteOnly) {
        super(senderId, sender);
        this.channel = channel;
        this.inviteOnly = inviteOnly;
    }

    @Override
    public Broadcast updateServerModel(ServerModel model) {
        String sender = getSender();
     Collection &lt;String&gt; newCol = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();
     newCol.add(sender);
      if (ServerModel.isValidName(channel))
         {
          model.createChannel(channel, getSender());
          return Broadcast.okay(this, newCol);
         }
      
     if (model.getChannels().contains(channel))
        {
         return Broadcast.error(this, ServerError.NAME_ALREADY_IN_USE);
        }
       
        return Broadcast.error(this, ServerError.INVALID_NAME);
    }

    public String getChannel() {
        return channel;
    }

    public boolean isInviteOnly() {
        return inviteOnly;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        int flag = inviteOnly ? 1 : 0;
        return String.format("":%s CREATE %s %d"", getSender(), channel, flag);
    }
}



Every time I run the program, it fails on a Null Pointer exception in my Channel.java class at this line: 
public void addUserChannel(String nickname)
 {
  usersInChannelList.add(nickname);
 }
 which I don't quite understand why it is throwing such an exception.

A null pointer exception is also found at my createChannel method in: 
c.addUserChannel(owner);

As well as in UpdateServerModel in: 
model.createChannel(channel, getSender());

And finally in the test itself, testCreateNewChannel, at 
assertEquals(""broadcast"", expected, create.updateServerModel(model));


I have been over and over my code and can't seem to find anything incorrect, although there clearly is something afoot as a null pointer exception has been found four times. I would really appreciate just even a hint as to which part to look at and try to edit. Thank you so much!	In the picture
 
Is it better to do (1)
else if (!model.getOwner(channel).equals(getSender()))
or to define a variable, then call it as in (2)
boolean ownerMatches = model.getOwner(channel).equals(getSender()
else if (!a)
	I am working on updateServerModel for CreateCommand in command.java. I want to broadcast okay to the owner of the channel once the channel has been successfully created. 
Currently, I have a getOwner method in ServerModel.java which returns string. 

For the updateServerModel, on the last line, I wrote
return Broadcast.okay(this, model.getOwner(channel));
but this is throwing an eror because the second input of the okay method has to be Collection. I can't change the getOwner return type because that means I have to change ServerModel.Api.

How should I solve this type mismatch problem?	Hi,
I really have some trouble debugging the leaveCommand. It'd be really much appreciated if you could give me a hint about where went wrong. My data structure in ServerModel Class is 
private static TreeMap&lt;Integer, String&gt; userPool;
private static TreeMap&lt;String, Channel&gt; channels;
And this is the body of my updateServerModel function inside leaveCommand except for the throwing errors part.
// errors...//if (getSender().equals(model.getOwner(channel))) {     	// if it's the owner who leaves
    		Collection&lt;String&gt; usersWereInChannel = model.getUsersInChannel(channel);
    		model.removeChannel(channel);
    		
    		return Broadcast.okay(this, usersWereInChannel);

    	} else { // existed member
    		Collection&lt;String&gt; usersWereInChannel = model.getUsersInChannel(channel);
    		model.removeUser(getSenderId(), channel); 
    		
    		return Broadcast.okay(this, usersWereInChannel);
    	}
And this is my remove methods in ServerModel, which is basically TreeMap.remove(Object id)
	public void removeChannel(String channel) {
		if (channels != null) {
			channels.remove(channel);
		}
	}
		public void removeUser (int senderId, String channel) {
		if (channels != null) {
			Channel n = channels.get(channel);
			n.removeUserChannel(senderId);
		}
	}
Do I have to remove users too if I've already removed the whole channel? I've passed all other tests except for Leave and KickUser, which I believe were similar strategies. I'm sorry to have posted so much code on piazza to debug, but i've been stuck here for an hour. Thank you	Now I passed the test!I fixed the code by create a variable Broadcast to return later, however, compared to my old code, why couldn't I create a variable Collection&lt;String&gt; of every user and the sender himself? Could you please explain a little bit about the difference between these two ways of thinking and why one of them is a bug?
// after debugif (getSender().equals(model.getOwner(channel))) {     	// if it's the owner
    		Collection&lt;String&gt; usersWereInChannel = model.getUsersInChannel(channel);
        	Broadcast toReturn = Broadcast.okay(this, usersWereInChannel);
    		model.removeChannel(channel);
        	return toReturn;
    	} // beforeif (getSender().equals(model.getOwner(channel))) {     	// if it's the owner who leaves
    		Collection&lt;String&gt; usersWereInChannel = model.getUsersInChannel(channel);
    		model.removeChannel(channel);
    		return Broadcast.okay(this, usersWereInChannel);}
	Hello! For the leaveCommand, I wrote the following removeUser code in ServerModel.java. I originally had concurrentmodificationexception because I was removing the user while iterating through usersOfChannel in the for-each loop. I resolved the problem by creating uuserToRemove set, but my code is still not working and I don't know why. 
 public Collection&lt;String&gt; removeUser(String channelName, int userId) {
    	Collection&lt;String&gt; usersOfChannel = getUsersInChannel(channelName);
    	Collection&lt;String&gt; userToRemove = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;();
    	userToRemove.add(umap.get(userId));
    	for(String user : userToRemove) {
    		if (user.equals(umap.get(userId)) &amp;&amp; umap.get(userId).equals(getOwner(channelName)))
    		{cmap.remove(channelName);}
    		else
    		{cmap.get(channelName).removeUser(userId);}
    	}
    	return usersOfChannel;
    }
Corresponding removeUser method in my Channel class
public void removeUser(int userId) {
		user.remove(userId);
	}
************************
EDIT: I took  the TA's advice and replaced the for loop. However, I think that maybe my leaveCommand itself is wrong. I remove the sender first then broadcast the message, but since the sender has been removed, does the message never get broadcasted? When I traced the error for one of the given test cases, it showed that I wasn't making any broadcast.

Here's my fixed code for removeUser in ServerModel.java
 public Collection&lt;String&gt; removeUser(String channel, int userId) {
    	Collection&lt;String&gt; usersOfChannel = getUsersInChannel(channel);
    	Collection&lt;String&gt; usersToRemove = getUsersInChannel(channel);
    	if (umap.get(userId).equals(getOwner(channel))) 
    	{
    		usersOfChannel.removeAll(usersToRemove);
    	}
    	else {
    		{cmap.get(channel).removeUser(userId);}
    	}
    	return usersOfChannel;
    }
Here's my code for leaveCommand in command.java
@Override
    public Broadcast updateServerModel(ServerModel model) {
    	if (!model.getChannels().contains(channel))
        { return Broadcast.error(this, ServerError.NO_SUCH_CHANNEL); }
        else if (!model.getUsersInChannel(channel).contains(this.getSender()))
        { return Broadcast.error(this, ServerError.USER_NOT_IN_CHANNEL); }
        model.removeUser(channel, this.getSenderId());
        return Broadcast.okay(this, model.getRecipients(this.getSender()));
    }
	Hi,
I'm a bit confused what's the point of toString() in Update. So when I return a Broadcast.okay(command, Collection&lt;String&gt;), how is my return statement affected by this override function? Do I need to call toString anywhere?
 @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("":%s LEAVE %s"", getSender(), channel);
    }
	public Broadcast deregisterUser(int userId) {
    	for (User u : allUsers) {
    		if (u.getID() == userId) allUsers.remove(u);
    	}
        
        Collection&lt;String&gt; rec = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;(); 
        
        for (Channel c : channels) {
        	if (c.contains(userId)) {
        		if (c.getOwner() == userId) channels.remove(c);
            	else {
            		c.remove(userId);
            		for (Integer i : c.getUserIds()) {
            			int id = i.intValue();
            			rec.add(getNickname(id));
            		}
            	}
        	}
        }
        
        Broadcast b = Broadcast.disconnected(getNickname(userId), rec);
        return b;
    }

My code is failing testDeregisterSingleUser and testDeregisterOneOfManyUsers. It is failing the first becuase of null pointer exceptions and the second for ConcurrentModificationException. Any clue what could be wrong with my code? I'm really not seeing where there's a null pointer and idk what the second error means	When submitting my code, I am failing the following test case: 
First failure is message to channel that user is not in fails: broadcast expected:&lt;{User1=[:User1 ERROR 404]}&gt; but was:&lt;{User0=[:User1 MESG java :hey friends]}&gt;
I've written multiple test cases where the user tries to message public and private channels that they aren't in, and I'm having trouble figuring out the problem because all of my test cases are passing. In my method, I store channels as objects of their own class and check to make sure that the user is in the channel using the .contains method for a set of members that is a part of the internal state of the class, i.e:

public class Channel implements Comparable&lt;Channel&gt; {	private int ownerid; //ID number of the owner	private boolean isprivate; //if the channel is invite only	private Set&lt;Integer&gt; members; //set of the ID numbers of members	private String name; //nickname of the owner		//creates a new channel	public Channel (int senderId, String sender, String channel, boolean 			inviteOnly) {		this.ownerid = senderId;		this.isprivate = inviteOnly;		// initialize the set of members and add the owner:		this.members = new TreeSet&lt;Integer&gt;();		members.add(senderId); 		this.name = sender;	}		//return a boolean indicating whether or not the user is a member	public boolean isMember (int userid) {		boolean x;		x = members.contains(userid);		return x;	}

and then my messaging method reads:

 if (channels.containsKey(channel)) {		  Channel ch = channels.get(channel);		  if (ch.isMember(senderId)) {			  Set&lt;String&gt; notify = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();			  //add the nicknames of the members to those getting notified			  for (Integer i : ch.getMembers()) {				  String j = users.get(i);		          notify.add(j);			  }		      return Broadcast.okay(command, notify); 		  }//alert the user that they are not in the channel		  else return Broadcast.error(command, ServerError.USER_NOT_IN_CHANNEL);	  }//alert the user that the channel does not exist	  else return Broadcast.error(command, ServerError.NO_SUCH_CHANNEL);

The way I learned 2-D arrays is row first, so if it's array[i][j] i would be the row number and j would be the column number. 

However, that doesn't intuitively match with the x coordinate/y coordinate framework, and I was thinking: since 2-d arrays are just arrays within arrays, can I not define it the way I want it to be? Why does java use (or why do classes teach) the row first method?

Let me know, thank you :) 	I'm doing 2048 and using Arrays.equals to see what the board (a 2D array) looks like after a move, and compare it to the expected values of the array. I know that the test should be passing because when I print the actual and expected arrays they have the exact same values. However, Arrays.equals is returning false. I wrote another method arraysEquals that goes through and makes sure each value of the array is the same (which I though it what Arrays.equals does) and this assertion is returning true like it should.

Is there some reason why Arrays.equals is returning false? Is it okay to use my own method to test the equality of two game board arrays or do I have to use Arrays.equals?

I saw @2581, but I’m writing this inside ServerModel and not one of the Command classes, so I can’t use “this.” In specific, I’m trying to handle errors in my changeNickname() function in ServerModel, which will be called from updateServerModel(). Appreciate the help!	I initially did the bulk of my command implementations in ServerModel and was just calling them in Command. For example,

 public Broadcast updateServerModel(ServerModel model) {        return model.createChannel(getSenderId(), getSender(), getChannel(), isInviteOnly());    }
Should this be backwards? Should I be implementing in Command and calling Command.updateServerModel in ServerModel?

My intuition was to write something like this: 
return Broadcast.error(Command.NicknameCommand, INVALID_NAME); but Eclipse doesn't seem to recognize the command name or the error - what should I be doing differently?	Is it okay if these methods are public in ServerModel or should they be made as a helper function in Command? Not exactly sure how a public method would interact with submissions.	It's clear that the homework requires adding methods to ServerModel in many different tasks, but is it ok if I've made a lot of new methods (like creating a new one for each command)? Or is that poor style and I should try to write more code in command itself instead of just calling a function in ServerModel that takes care of the code?	What does invalid command type error mean? 

I don't get this error in any of my other methods, but it pops up in kickCommand	Can we define any number of functions we want in servermodel if it will help us in command? Even if they are not directly related to the method we are implementing in command? For instance, the instructions say ""For instance, you might consider adding a changeNickname method to your ServerModel class,"" but could we add other functions that are not changeNickname or equivalent functions for equivalent methods in command?	I made a separate file for the class. Is there a way to call it there similar to in Command.java or would it be easier just to call it within ServerModel?	How do I input a command into the Broadcast.error(Command command, ServerError error) function? It will not let me use Nickname(___) or Command(__).	All the default tests are passing for ConnectionNicknamesTest as of now, but wanted to check:
when a client is interacting with the program, would they be calling a Command i.e. do you need to call ServerModel's changeNickname() method (depending on whether the criterion for a correct name are met) from the Command class itself?

And for listener light, is it supposed to turn on whenever state light flips? 	When we implement checkbox function, should we need to account for the mouse position when pattern matching for events, or does the notifier take this into account and only respond to mouse clicks in the widget?

Also, do I need to have three color sliders or is having just one controlling the color's shade okay?	Regardless of whether the user wants to draw one or many points, do we only add Points of Gctx.color * point list to the shape type? 
So we don't need something like Point of Gctx.color * point?	When we are trying to create Points with a specific color, what would be the way to get the color of the current graphics context? I tried to gc.color where gc is of type gctx but it gives me an error. The other alternative would be to use paint.color but then what is the difference of getting color from a graphic context or getting it from paint?	still not clear on the difference between paint.color and a Gctx.color bc it seems as though paint.color is being used for the lines	type shape = 
  | Line of color * point * point
  | Points of Gctx.color * point list 
  | Elipse of color * point * point 
For the given code file, Line was defined as color * point * point. In Task 3, however, it says in the descriptions that Points should be Gctx.color. I am a bit confused about this nuance and was wondering why that is the case. I guess it probably has to do with color being a field for the gctx type but also a type defined in Gctx? 

An additional question is then: for tasks 3 and 4 in paint_action, why do we store in preview Some shape with the color attribute of paint.color instead of gc.color (which couldn't be done as it returned an error). Shouldn't it have the color of the current graphics context? A bit confused about how a graphics context's color interacts with the paint state's color. Thank you! 	Hi!

I'm working on task 6, trying to do the color sliders. My first instinct to accomplish this task was to have the sliders affect the color (i.e paint.color.r &lt;- __), however I would have to make the type mutable in gctx, which wouldn't work b/c the gctx is supposed to be immutable.

My next idea is to make the widget have a value controller that holds a number from 0-255 depending on the location of the mouse. Then I would create a mutable type in paint.ml that was of the same form as the type of color and could update. Then, ideally, I could apply that mutable color type to paint.color and all would be well and good. However, I have a few concerns I would like to run past someone before I change a bunch of my code:

1- Am I right in assuming I can't make the color type mutable? When I tried to change it it said that it was incompatible with the cmi but I don't know what that is.

2- Will it be an issue if I use a record within paint.ml and try to apply to to paint.color? I'm not sure it will work, since one is mutable and the other is not and because the type is only defined within Gctx so I don't think it will even be applicable. 

3- Is it necessary to create an entirely new mutable state in paint that co-exists with color? It does not seem efficient, but I am not sure where else to look for color mutability.

Basically all I've played around with so far has lead to errors but I can't make office hours. I think my main confusion rests in what is allowed to be mutable. I want to make sure that I am understanding this conceptually before I change a bunch of code.

Thank you :) 	Can we change fill_rect so that it takes in a color as one of its parameters? I am doing this for drawing the sliders. 	In paint.ml, how do we create a color using the rgb function in gctx?	When we implement the slider, do we have to update it with every press of a color button to match the rgb values of the preset colors like Swap's does, or can we just have it act like a separate color button?	let adjustcolor (i: int) : unit =begin match paint.color with| {r; g; b} -&gt; paint.color &lt;- {i; g; b};

For some reason I get an error that this record expression is supposed to have type Gctx.color but i does not belong to type Gctx.color.

Isn't a color just a record with three ints?
If I just use straight up ints e.g. {10; 10; 10} I get an error that after unclosed { expecting ""with"". What's going on here?	
In the example screen in the homework description, there are two color indicators. Is it okay if we have just one that still displays the current color produced by the slider?	if I click any of the predefined color squares, should my color slider change correspondingly?
Or  is it okay if it just don't do anything?	When I try to change the color of paint.color, this color type is defined in Gctx, so I can't use Graphic.rgb function defined in Graphic interface to change the color of the paint state. Are we allowed to make a function in Gctx that has type  int -&gt; int -&gt; int -&gt; Gctx.color to convert, since this would just be creating a new color every single time the function is called (ie every time the slider is clicked on)?	I am stuck on the last two pieces of color slider. My slider bars are all black. When drawing those filled rectangles, how to do I change only the color value passed into the gctx with g? Also, how do I change the text size for a draw_string?	My color slider seems to interfere with the way the color black is defined. Sliding it changes everything in black, but the other pre-defined colors are fine. What could be contributing to this error? 	I am in the midst of adding thickness, I added the relevant definitions in gctx and paint state etc. I didn't touch any part of the provided colors buttons and definitions. However, now all the squares in the color control bar are all black. I can draw lines, but I can't update to any color.	Umm I don't think that resolves my problem. I am confused why in other posts the instructors said that don't change thickness globally. However, the color button changes the global color.	For slider, how do we update just either the r, g, or b value of color? It's my understanding they aren't mutable per say but color is?	Hi,
If I pick up a color, does it need to automatically reset the color slider bar? 

	If we store a redundant state for r g b in our paint.ml implementation of color slider will we get points off even if it works properly?	My slider implementation seems to work fine when dragging each bar and selecting colors still works. However, if I select a color and then try to drag any colors bar the resulting color is not what I'd expect. If I drag the other sliders to set the values of paint.color as the appropriate bar it will work again. I believe the issue is that when a predetermined color is selected it changes paint.color but not the visuals of the bars. I'm not sure how to fix this. Any suggestions?	if this helps, the orientation is completely correct, just not the color	I'm trying to change my window's background color to black by creating a JPanel, then using panel.setBackground(Color.BLACK).

I notice that people have asked similar questions but I'd just like to clarify explicitly: If our code catches an I/O exception, and we don't want to throw a new exception that would crash the program, should we, in the catch block, simply print an informative error message to the console?

1) m does not need to throw the illegal arguemnt exception? So we should just delete that part?
2) why do q and s need to throw the IO Exception?  I thought by calling method n, method n already helps them handle the IO Exception? 
3) it says r does not need to throw IOException, is it because it has a catch clause so it does not need to throw? I thought if q and s need to throw the IOException then r should also throw... or at least add the throw clause within the catch clause? What should r be exactly? 	

Hi, I'm a little confused- what's the purpose of putting 
c = -1
into the

throw new IOException();
then does the program stop when it catches an exception?


Another separate question: why should we put 
c != -1
after 
!Character.isLetter(c)
? Won't this cause NullPointerException?

So I tried to do this by assigning it to a variable, then updating r.contents by one and just returning the previously assigned variable. 

But the test fails. Is this not the correct approach?	I'm not sure I understand what add_change_listener is supposed to do.  The instructions says it adds a new change listener function ('a -&gt; unit) to the value controller's list of change_listeners.

I can't see a way to create/store a list of change_listeners given the types in the record. Since add_change_listener isn't mutable in the provided type code, it doesn't seem like we're supposed to update it with each call. (I did try to create a mutable field in make_control outside of the record, but it was fruitless..

I also don't follow how it's supposed to listen for changes to the values without using a bool or a counter, but these don't seem like options given the make_controller framework provided.

Would it be possible to clarify what add_change_listener does and how the functions are stored? 

In terms of the test, is t.contents is now a reference to v?

I'm doing what was suggested above - first update contents of value controller, then iterate through all the change_listeners and apply/update contents of value controller.

I'm still getting a runtime error that the value of make_control doesn't match. It seems to be coming from my List.iter but I don't understand why.	I'm trying to store the 'a value and the list of change listeners in make_control like so

  let value : 'a ref = ref v in
  let change_listener_list : ('a -&gt; unit) list ref = ref [] in
Does resemble working code? It's not throwing any errors in those lines but suddenly now my record where I implement the functions has get_value and change_value as undefined / unbound.

I'm so confused.	Look, I can't come to office hours so I need help with this function so I can at least move on and not spend the next 8 hours staring at this.

let make_control (v: 'a) : 'a value_controller =

    get_value = (fun () -&gt; value.contents); (*just return v?*)

    value.contents &lt;- v;

  }
Issues:
  1) Both get_value and change_value are coming up as unbound and I don't understand why just these two and not also add_change_listener

  2) change_value is giving the ""this is a bool instead of unit"" error that apparently happens when you don't have parenthesis. So I added parenthesis before and after the whole anonymous function but nothing happened. Is this ocaml being stupid (i mean that goes without question) or is this a logic error or something in that function?

"	I understand that a helix is a list of nucleotides. However, since the helix becomes a new datatype in itself, how do you still use the functionality of a list? For example, how could I refer to the first element within helix?	What if there are two helices that are the same hamming distance from the helix for the humans, but at the same time they are not duplicates of each other?
For example, if the helix for humans began like: [A; A; T; T; C; C; G; G], what would be the output for a list that contained [A; A; C; C; C; C; G; G] and [A; A; T; T; G; G; G; G] (which both have a hamming distance of 2 when compared with humans), if otherwise, the helix list was strictly decreasing?	For the decreasing_similarity function should we assume that the human helix never appears in the input list?	Should we still count a Leaf if it contains an empty helix?	If a labeled_tree has multile LNodes and LLeafs, each containing helices, which helix should this function return?

Thanks 	I am getting a yellow warning dot for my pattern matching of two helices because I do not have the case for an empty helix against a helix with nucleotides in it. I don't think I need this match case because we are assuming that the helices are the same length, and an empty helix has length 0 while the other helix would have length 1. Should I ignore it? What should I do?	Is the helix associated with a labeled leaf considered ""the helix contained within the given tree"". That is, should we just return that helix if passed a leaf?	If we're comparing the helix [A,G] with the empty list [ ], would this be a valid comparison?	I am confused with the following instructions, can't a labeled tree have multiple internal nodes and leaves, and therefore can't it have more than one helix? What does it mean when it is asking us to find the contained helix?

(* Find the helix contained within the given tree. The type definition will be * helpful here. *)

let helix_of_tree (t: labeled_tree) : helix = failwith ""helix_of_tree: unimplemented""	Helix of Tree only requires the top most helix, right? 	how come helix_of_tree is not recursive if we need to look through the tree for the top helix?	Which helix is helix_of_tree supposed to return? A labeled_tree has several helixes in it (in the leaves and in the nodes).	let rec count_leaves (t: tree) : int =
  begin match t with 
    | Leaf (helix1) -&gt; 1
    | Node (tree1, tree2) -&gt; count_leaves tree1 + count_leaves tree2
  end
For type matching in the trees, why can't we say Leaf (helix) or Node (tree * tree) to represent the general type of what t is? Also, I just added a 1 after helix just so that it doesn't get confused with the data type helix, but why would it be wrong to put the data type there instead of just filler variable names?	If the labeled_tree has just a leaf I want to return the helix in that leaf.

But my pattern match case

| lleaf(helix) -&gt; helix

raises two errors.
1) syntax error after unclosed begin, expect -&gt;
2) unbound value helix

I feel like this should be blindingly simple but I don't understand either.	I cannot wrap my mind around NOT using pattern matching to convert all_trees's tree list to add_ancestor_labels to simplest_tree. For me, add_ancestor_labels tells me I have to use pattern matching since it is not in list form. However, my test cases for this function will not run and Codio is taking forever

"	Hello! My reducePalette currently takes about 4 seconds, and since the efficient time is 1 or 2 seconds, I was wondering on how to make my code more efficient

    public static PixelPicture reducePalette(PixelPicture pic, int numColors) {
        ColorMap colorMap = new ColorMap();
        int w = pic.getWidth();
        int h = pic.getHeight();
        
        Pixel[][] bmp = pic.getBitmap();
        for (int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++) {
            for (int y = 0; y &lt; h; y++) {
                Pixel p = bmp[x][y];
                if (!colorMap.contains(p)) {
                    colorMap.put(p, 1); 
                }
                else {
                    colorMap.put(p, colorMap.getValue(p) + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        Pixel[] sortedPixels = colorMap.getSortedPixels(); 
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; w; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; h; j++) {
                Pixel closest = sortedPixels[0];
                Pixel p = bmp[i][j];   
                for (int k = 0; k &lt; numColors; k++) {
                    if (p.distance(closest) &gt; p.distance(sortedPixels[k])) {
                        closest = sortedPixels[k];
                    }
                }  
                bmp[i][j] = closest;
            }
        }   
        return new PixelPicture(bmp);
    }
Since the color map needs to be formed before I found out what the closest Pixel is, I would need to seperate the two loops, so I couldn't merge them together. Could I get any hints as to how to improve it? 	Hello! I think I'm misunderstanding how to use the ColorMap class to implement getSortedPixels. I have the following code right now:
public static PixelPicture reducePalette(PixelPicture pic, int numColors) {
    	int w = pic.getWidth();
        int h = pic.getHeight();
        int dist = 255;
        
        Pixel p = new Pixel(0, 0, 0);
        Pixel[][] src = pic.getBitmap();
        ColorMap map = new ColorMap();
        
        Pixel[] palette = map.getSortedPixels();
        
    	for (int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++) {
    		for (int y = 0; y &lt; h; y++) {
    			for (int i = 0; i &lt; numColors - 1; i++) {
    				if ((src[x][y].distance(palette[i])) &lt; dist) {
    					dist = src[x][y].distance(palette[i]);
    					p = palette[i];
    				}
    				src[x][y] = p;
    			}
    		}
    	}
    	return new PixelPicture(src);
    }
The way I was trying to approach this was to first create an array of Pixels using getSortedPixels, then loop through that for the size of the palette. As it loops, I wanted to store a value tracking distance dist and a Pixel p whenever the distance was less than the one before it. However, I have been getting an ArrayOutOfBoundsException saying that one of the arrays is empty. Am I using ColorMap wrong, or is it something else?"

Why is the answer int set set instead of ill typed? Isn's set_of_list supposed to take in a list but in f it's taking in a set?





val set_of_list : ’a list -&gt; ’a set 





let f : ______________int set set ______________ = set_of_list [add 3 empty] 


	let f : ______________int set set ______________ = set_of_list [add 3 empty]

How is this an int set set? set_of_list is of type 'a list -&gt; 'a set, so I'm confused on how to determine the type."
"	So I have been trying to implement set_of_list for a while and it doesn't seem to be working. I tried 
let rec set_of_list (l: 'a list) : 'a set = begin match l with |[] -&gt; [] |x :: rest -&gt; if (exists (fun z -&gt; z &lt; x) l) then set_of_list((filter' (fun z -&gt; z &lt; x) l) @ [x] @ (filter' (fun z -&gt; z &gt; x) l)) else x :: set_of_list rest end

This leads to all my test cases passing besides the ones where there are multiple repeating elements. So I tried adding onto it doing:

let rec set_of_list (l: 'a list) : 'a set = begin match l with |[] -&gt; [] |x :: rest -&gt; if (exists (fun z -&gt; z &lt; x) l) then set_of_list((filter' (fun z -&gt; z &lt; x) l) @ [x] @ (filter' (fun z -&gt; z &gt; x) l)) else if (exists (fun z -&gt; z = x) l) then set_of_list rest else x :: set_of_list rest end

Hello! I wrote a bit of code and it passes the tests. However, I just wanted to be sure that I understood what was going on. Would it be appropriate to understand the references as sort of a mutable local variable in Java? Essentially, whenever I make a value controller and update it by changing it or adding listeners, will the value controller continue to have the value reference and the listeners reference to store the data? And would I just be mutating the references to store different information? I was a bit unsure as I am making the value and listeners as sort of ""local"" but I think it would make more sense to make the part of the record to be ""inherent"" to the controller. 	I have been stuck on this for a while, and I can't figure out the error. It keeps saying that there is a ""Syntax error after unclosed {, expecting '}' "" I suspect I'm doing something wrong with the iterating through the list of listeners?
let make_control (v: 'a) : 'a value_controller =  let value = ref v in  let listeners = ref [] in  { add_change_listener = (fun (x:'a -&gt; unit) -&gt; listeners := x :: !listeners);    get_value = (fun () -&gt; !value);    change_value = (fun x -&gt; value := x);      (List.iter (fun (lis:'a -&gt; unit) -&gt; lis !value) !listeners);  }
	Are we supposed to be defining these using high-order functions? I have implemented mine to be this but my tests are failing? I am not really sure what I am supposed to doing honestly. 

{ add_change_listener = (fun (c: 'a -&gt; unit) -&gt; ());  get_value = (fun () -&gt; v);  change_value = (fun v -&gt; ());  }	Is this a potential 3rd solution?:

"	I'm working on task 2, and so far my drag and drop seems to be half-working. now, i can only draw lines if i begin by dragging with the mouse, but I have to click again after releasing the mouse to end the line, instead of just being able to release the mouse for the line to appear. I've been reading through and I can't figure out where the problem with my logic is :( I'm wondering where in general I'm messing up	So I think my drag and drop function works. But as soon as we release the mouse button, should the line appear? 
For example, if I clicked down, drag my mouse over, and then release the mouse without moving at all, the line doesn't appear until I trigger another event (i.e. moving my mouse after releasing). So assuming I release the button at one position in the canvas, and stay at that position, should the line be shown? Or is it ok that the line is shown only when I trigger another event (i.e. move the mouse one pixel from the position I released the mouse click)?	when i drag and drop to draw a line, it disappears as soon as I move my mouse. i'm not sure why this is happening. 	My mouse drag for point mode does not work. I don't understand why it's not working. Right now, there's only a point on mouse down and nothing during mouse drag. Please help. 
	When I run the code and try dragging the mouse across the screen (in point mode), the point path won't display until i release the button. I can't figure out how to get the points to draw as the drag is happening. Any advice? 	When I draw lines or ellipses, everything seems to work correctly except for when I release my mouse, an additional black line or ellipse appears until I move my mouse again.  I can't figure out why this happens.  Where in my code should I look to solve this?

"	Hi, 

I made a working color slider. However, I found that if I made the slider size greater than 254 on the last pixel it turned the color back to as if the slider was at 0. I had originally thought that the size should be 255 because there are 256 possible numbers (0-255). I am confused as to why only 255 (0-254) colors can be represented in the size, since I have each pixel being one color.

Thanks!
	Ohh yes it should be min of 255 and fst p. Thanks!!	For the pixel constructor that takes in an int array, do we assume that the the values in the int array are &gt;=0 and &lt;=255? Or do we have to handle that like in the other constructor?	For color scale, if the multiplier is too large (say 1000), should every pixel become white since its rgb would be (255,255,255)? 	When i am testing getComponents(), all my tests are failing but when I print out the array of p1.getComponents() for example, I get [255, 0, 30] which is exactly what array x is. Is there something wrong with the way I wrote the test?

int[] x = {255, 0, 30};
assertEquals (x,p1.getComponents());	how do I clip out arguments that are not between 0 and 255. when i use if-then-else, i keep getting an error.	Here is part of my code for the PixelPicture border function. I'm getting a warning from eclipse that p1 is not used, even though I've clearly used it. Is it because p1 is being initialized separately from when its defined as a pixel?

"	All tests up to question 5 pass while question 6 appears as ""Running: test_join nonempty separator ... make: *** [run] Killed""	Hello, I just submitted HW1. My code passes all the tests on Codio, but when I submitted to the dashboard, the tests timed out. How can I find out which section is causing the time out?	Hi, could someone please look at my acids_of_helix function?
I created a helper function find_TAC which locates the first TAC in the helix and keeps TAC and the rest of the helix after TAC.

I traced through my code and believe my logic is right but none of the tests for acids_of_helix pass. My helper function did pass all tests.

Thank you!	If the comment above the test cases for each problem doesn't say be sure to add your own and only asks to complete the tests provided do we have to add our own tests?	I commented out the section where you guys warn that it might go slow if we run the print commands. However, whenever I run my tests, Codio is taking forever to evaluate the simplest_lesser and simplest_greater functions that were created for us. Is this a problem with just me or is this fine? Not sure how to approach it because I'm not sure if there's something I need to fix (the homework came with these functions pre-written). 	I thought I was finished with question 7, as all my tests have been passing and my logic seems correct (or so I thought), but when I printed the greater and lesser apes trees, neither matched the tree in Figure A. I fear that something might be off with either my question 5 or 6, but they pass all my tests, so I'm not sure. If there is any overt issue with my logic, I would greatly appreciate a point in the right direction.	Are we supposed to write our own tests for problem 8 too? Most of the other test sections say what to do, but 8 just says that it should equal the same thing and then tests the greater and lesser apes problems using both functions.	The tests that I write in the higher order file to test the functions that I implement do not appear in the terminal when I run high order, is there a way for me to be able to see them in the terminal ?	Are we supposed to have tests for debug_name??	The tests are showing up now but I am a little confused if there is any way to know that we have written the correct tests since the functions they depend on haven't been written yet	I feel like in most cases, within each test , we are using more than one functions.
for example, set of list and list of set are used in tests of other functions for lots of times, do I still need to write tests for these two functions, or is it okay if I just assume that they are tested within other tests already?	what does:

""After the tests are written, you should be able to implement the functions one at a time in the same order and see your tests incrementally pass.""

mean? 

also, i'm a bit confused how we are supposed to write tests with generic values. in class, we tested using integers but that assumes that type 'a is an integer, correct? even testing for both strings and integers doesn't cover nearly all the combinations... is it possible to define values of type 'a and use it for all the tests?	Yes!New functions aren't appearing - rather new tests are, that I haven't defined before. It seems like the back end test checkers that the graders use is showing up	Is it necessary to run the same tests but using different types (string, int, bool)? 	When I run simpleQueue, I don't see any of the QueueTests in the terminal. Only the tests written in imp.ml show up. Does anyone know why this is happening?	It is failing my tests. I read @803 and I thought that my code would accomplish returning [1; 2; 3] in the given case. 	Hi--I opened Homework 4 in Codio, but the tests for problem 1 have red underlines; they are not tests that I wrote, so I assume there is nothing wrong with the tests... I closed and reloaded Codio after substantial time and they still appear to be there. Does anyone have any idea what might be the issue?	When I ran my tests for delete, a few of them returned ""to_list: given invalid queue."" Out of curiosity I commented out the ""if valid"" part of the to_list function and the tests passed. I was wondering if this is allowed or if I should try a new implementation?

The tests that specifically triggered the invalid queues were ones that involved deleting multiple elements that were separated by undeleted ones.	Also one of the tests for is_empty is failing now for linkedQueue, and it wasn't before (and I don't think I accidentally deleted or typed anything in there).	I wrote my truncate function, and it passes the first couple tests, but then it fails the later ones, but the failure appears to be with to_list... it says that ""reported `to_list: given invalid queue,`"" so I don't know if there's something wrong with my tests...	I'm having a hard time coming up for other tests for refs_aliased like I can't think of any other test, it seems like it's covered	I am pretty sure the deques I wrote were valid. Besides that, though it doesn't seem as though the tests are calling any of the queues I created so that wouldn't really make sense either. 	In the delete / truncate functions of LinkedQueue, is it ok, when updating q.tail to set q.tail &lt;- Some n or is that bad because it is a new option? It passes the tests, but I was wondering if what I have written for code would be considered following the ""in place"" requirement...	I'm running linkedQueue to see if it passes the tests I wrote in queueTest but it will only run the tests in imp.ml? should I be running something else?	I do have the following keyword but the tests are still not running.	I tried it, but it doesn't seem to be changing the value in the value_controller, because the tests for clicking are failing.	I finished task 1 and all the tests are passing. However, when I run paint, it looks like:



I don't know why there is a big margin below each widget...	I have implemented checkboxes for question 5 and everything works fine in both lightbulb and the actual paint application, but for some reason a few of the checkbox tests aren't passing. Do I need to be concerned about this? Is there something wrong with my implementation?	When I run my JUnit tests for MyPixelTest, only the original ""testConstructInBounds()"" shows up. Like the runs show 1/1 instead of all the tests I've written. Is there something I should configure?	
what does this error mean? my JUnit tests run and pass for MyPixelTest, and I have MyTest in the same directory as MyPixelTest and I have updated the path at the top of MyPixelTest to find the test images.	
When I rotate the image clockwise in the gui it changes the Rgb value and it also does not pass the tests that were written for it. I was wondering what is occurring, thank you	After I do that, it's also saying that no JUnit tests are available. When I right-click on the test folder it does not give me the build path option.	How do I know if my tests have passed or failed?

I submitted my file and it said that it was submitted successfully. However, it did not give any detail to which tests I passed and which I failed.

Hi - I am wondering why there is no ""default package"" under ""test.""

well this was my setup and it would say No JUnit Tests Found for JUnit 4 Tester but I clicked run just now and this popped up- I guess that means it's okay? does this mean my tests passed?
	Whenever I try to run these tests, I get the result in the picture below - the tests aren't running. MyPixelTest works fine however. In addition, when using any of the advanced manipulation methods, the GUI freezes and nothing happens - no errors either. Simple manipulations work however. I have no idea why this is happening.

Thank you!	I also just submitted my code to get an idea of what I should be working on; my code passes the BorderTest tests.	I've submitted my code and most of tests ran successfully, although I saw an error message at the top that said:

First failure is PixelComponentRnegarr: Pixel Component Array R clipped expected: but was:

What could this mean?	All the tests for my pixel class passed but im not sure why my manipulate tests fail; I've traced and looked through the failing functions multiple and they seem to be all right. No idea why this is happening.	I see that testing is worth 5 percent of our grade for this assignment, yet I never noticed specific instructions that required testing. I am happy to add tests, but I just want to get a sense of where exactly I should be adding them and to test which functions. 	For ConnectionNicknamesTest, I am getting a ""No JUnit tests found."" How do I fix this error?	In the manual grading section, it says ""quality of testing"" is 5% of the grade. Does this mean more JUnit tests are expected?
	When I add more JUnit tests,  should I add all of them to the ServerModelTest file?	I just finished writing code to change nickname (in both serverModel and the updateServerModel method of the Nickname Command) but I'm not passing any of the Nick tests. (I'm passing all tests for register and deregister). I'm struggling to find the bug in my code. I've looked at the failed tests and the error is always in the line that checks if the broadcast I returned matches the expected broadcast. Any debugging suggestions would be greatly appreciated.	I still dont have the squares with the crosses through them in my file setup, and when I went to run my tests, it said that no tests were found. I did add JUnit 4 to the libraries.	The JUnit tests should be completely different from the ones provided, correct? Meaning that we assume that the JUnit tests in the three files have already been tested with our project and that we are now trying other cases that the given ones did not test?	This is my third submission attempt. My second one did not include some tests and the plan was unfinished. So I finished the plan.txt and added some more tests. But when I try to submit, I get that message. 	I'm trying to find the current nicknames of my users within my tests. Can I do this elsewhere?	Im setting up a new java project but I can't run any of my tests. It says that I have no JUnit tests when I try to run it, but I added the library when I set it up. I tried to do the Build path thing, but I don't have that option when I right click on the test file. Do you know what could be the issue? Here's how it looks right now: 
Screen_Shot_20181115_at_3.01.45_PM.png	how do I run JUnit tests in codio?	I'm passing every test that was provided to us in all the files (green bars when I run the file tests), and every custom test I made. Yet when I turn in my homework, half of the tests are failing...Does this make sense? I don't even know where to look...my chat server is also functioning properly when I run it on my computer

My zipped project includes:
Command.java
ServerModel.java
ServerModelTest.java
PLAN.txt
Channel.java (custom class)
Client.java (custom class)	So I'm submitting with a lot of failed tests that I don't know how to remedy. It seems the solution is ""spend hours trying to think of edge cases and make JUnit tests to do this."" That seems unnecessarily tedious.

I don't really care about the server tests but I am curious about the encapsulation tests. Is there any way I can get feedback on how I'm violating encapsulation after I submit and the homework is fully graded?

	I'm trying to run the InviteOnly JUnit test. When I run it, I find that all 3 fail. However, I found it a little weird how each ends in 0.000 seconds. Is it simply that my code is wrong? 	for the token scanner tests, the instructions suggest we test for any empty input. does this mean an empty string (""""), or a completely empty input? 	So I know we have to provide tests for grading for ServerModel, but do we need to provide tests for everything in ServerModel (including functions that we created) or just the ones that say ""This method is provided for testing""?	I just submitted my homework 7 files, finding out that I failed about 2/5 of the tests and got 53/80 but I've past all given tests and the tests I've written and finished all portions of the assignment. So I feel very strange with the grading. I really want to know what exact tests I am actually failing.

Is there any way to know about that? 

I am really confused about the score, so plz.	When writing tests for TokenScanner, how do I write tests where the expected output is either an IllegalArgumentException or an IOException? I am not sure what the syntax is regarding assertEquals() and assertTrue().	When trying to run tests on TokenScanner, a window with error appears saying: No JUnit tests found. I see JUnit4 imported into my file-tree though. What should I do?	How do I know if my tests for TokenScanner are passing? When I run MyTests, it only runs 1/6 of the tests and has a little blue triangle next to that test.	when i try to run the provided tests to the dictionary class, I get null pointer exceptions to the first two tests - is it because my files aren't opened correctly? 	In the assignment instructions, it says the best way to check SpellCheck is via the console (command line). Does this mean we do not have to write JUnit tests for this part?	Is it okay to submit our own .txt files we created to test our code? Otherwise, I am not sure how our JUnit tests could be tested	What does it mean by ""Tests are not unit tests (e.g. tests both height &lt; 2 and width &lt; 2)""?
	
I know the idea of a unit test is that it only tests one thing, so is it okay if our unit tests for TokenReader test if a line is read correctly like in this test that was given to us, or can there only be one assert statement in our tests?	this is what my hw 7 looked like too and the tests ran; when i right click on tests, there is no option to build path.	I am getting a FileNotFoundException when I run my Dictionary tests. I think it has something to do with how my project is set up. How can I fix this?


 	Out of curiosity: Why do the dictionary tests have timeout=500? 	Hey, I'm not really sure why I'm receiving a NullPointerException at lines 31 and 46 of Dictionary.java.  My isWord() passes the provided tests and I don't see how I could be implementing the add method wrong?

	Any idea why my dictionary tests time out?
The homework said to think about what type of collection, we're using, but I thought TreeSets were supposed to be pretty efficient for lookups. 	I'm passing the tests in SpellCheckerTest, but ""Invalid Input. Please try again!"" is printed several times in my console. What does this mean? 	Hello, 
I've finished implementing SpellChecker.java and all my tests except Gettysburg are passing. It completely understand WHY it's failing but am very confused about HOW that bug is possible given how my code is written, and I've been very stuck trying to fix it. The problem is:

After correcting""Fuor"" (the first word), either ""four"" or ""Four"" somehow gets outputted as the first suggested correction for each of the subsequent words. The same type of problem doesn't occur for either of the other two tests SpellChecker tests. I've added print statements everywhere and gone over the logic many times, but I'm still stuck trying to figure it out. 

Has anyone else had this problem and does anyone have any suggestions for fixing? 

Thank you!	I don't think I understand what getNextInt is. The way I'm using it currently is to get the selection from the user about what to do with words that aren't in the dictionary. My code passes the tests in SpellCheckerTest, but 
""Invalid input. Please try again!""is printed a bunch of times in my console, so that means there's an issue with how I'm calling getNextInt.

	Should we use smalldictionary.txt like the ones in the given tests do? or use dictionary.txt ? 

thanks	2/3 of my Spell Checker tests passed, then something changed (I'm not sure what) and now they all fail. It seems to have something to do with my FileWriter, but tracing through it takes me to code I didn't write. How should I approach debugging? Thanks!

	I'm pretty sure I am declaring that the test might throw an IOException.... This test is also one of the tests given (DictionaryTest.java)
	1. Are we supposed to submit our test case .txt files?
2. Are we to write junit tests for Task 4, or are we just to test through Runner?
	When I submit spellchecker all of the tests run and work fine except that the spellcheckertests don’t work at all or even give me feedback. I had assumed I made errors and resubmitted and now I have lost 5 points for submitting past 3 what should I do? The spellchecker works as expected when tested in eclipse.	I am writing a couple of tests that are supposed to throw exceptions. Within those tests there are some variables that are not used since an exception is thrown before them or even on that line. Eclipse gives a warning for these that the local variable is not used. Will this also be an error when I submit?	No my tests still pass, but the output still says 
Invalid input. Please try again!
a bunch times	I'm trying to move my hw08 into Eclipse from Codio so I can better debug, but I've been running into issues. I had to get help to do this for the previous two java assignments as well; the instructions don't seem to be working for me. The last two times my projects were imported, the TAs imported them in a way that was different than the project instructions described, so I don't remember how to do it. Currently, the issue is that I can't get any tests running. When I click on the tests folder that I imported, the build project selection doesn't show up. Thanks!

When I try to run any tests, Eclipse reports that JUnit can't find any tests. When I right click on the test folder, I can't find any Build Path option. Should I be looking elsewhere?	When I try to run the tests I wrote for my game, Eclipse gives me the error message no JUnit Tests found. How can I resolve this issue?	Do we have to provide JUnit tests even if we already have 4 concepts?	I meant that if FileI/O is also one of my concepts, do I also have to write tests for that?	Any idea why my GameTest.java cannot be run as a JUnit test? Thanks. 	If I choose not to implement ""Using JUnit on a testable component"" and include nothing in /tests folder, will it affect my score?	If one of our concepts is the testable component, are we expected to test the File I/O if we implemented that? If so, I am confused how to do that. I looked through the SpellChecker homework tests, but the compareDocs helper method in the SpellChecker test does not work for my tests.
Thanks!	How many JUnit Tests should we have (given you can see if its working by playing the game)?

Do we need tests for every method, in every class, or do we choose important ones?	When you're doing testing, can you create variables like arrays, outside of the individual tests that get called by the tests (so that you don't have to retype the same stuff) ?	If we have methods that are intended exclusively for JUnit tests and are not used in the actual game logic is it okay if they break encapsulation or can cause exceptions since they're not intended for general use? If not, is there a way to make these exclusively accesible from our JUnit test class and private to everything else?	Is it still necessary to submit a test file in our submission files if Junit tests was not one of our 4 design concepts we implemented? 	Hello! Are we required to write tests even if Testable isn't one of our main concepts? And if testable is one of our main concepts, what are the minimum amount of tests that are expected?	Gotcha! In this case, how would I be able to test that it is working properly? In the error handling, I print out messages when I catch the error. For my tests, would it be enough credit for me to make instances where I throw the error and check from the interactions pane with my eye that the message is being printed? (In which case the JUnit tests would fail..) OR is there a way to do this with JUnit? 	Should we use those tests to pull out the array and then try to change it (and then see if the actual thing that got copied changes)?	If alot of my game logic functionality relies on user input to dialog boxes (like confirming a play), then when writing junit tests, can I instruct the junit tester how to respond to the dialog boxes for the purposes of the test? I can't see any other way to test game logic without removing all the dialog boxes	I just submitted once to see what would happen and I got this:

Screen_Shot_20181210_at_9.42.44_PM.png

That says it was successful, but I never added a .jar file for JUnit (I used eclipse). Did it automatically add that so that the tests would pass? Also, I am using a Mac. Can somebody just check my submission from their end and let me know if everything submitted correctly?	What are these MakeFiles and JarFiles? Do we need them for JUnit Tests?"

How can I fix this?	""You might choose to design your own text or binary file format and have your game read and write files using that format. Note that this format must be one of your own design and keep track of at least two pieces of state.""

What does keeping track of two pieces of state mean? If I am using I/O to implement high scores, would two pieces of state be the score and the name of the player?	I am still confused by what the instructions mean by ""Note that this format must be one of your own design and keep track of at least two pieces of state.""

""Note that this format must be one of your own design and keep track of at least two pieces of state. If Java already has a library for parsing this format, then this is not an appropriate use of this concept. You may write your own, but using the library provided by Java will earn 0 points.""

Does this mean that imported and using said imported TokenScanner is permissible? What does this mean isn't permitted?	The instructions say this:

Note that this format must be one of your own design and keep track of at least two pieces of state. If Java already has a library for parsing this format, then this is not an appropriate use of this concept. You may write your own, but using the library provided by Java will earn 0 points.

I am currently putting data in a single line and using readLine(). Would that be acceptable?	It says that File I/O formatting can't be the same as the comma separated format from HW 08. Does that mean on each line of my txt I can separate first names from the corresponding score using a colon?	Hi! just double checking, for I/O, in my txt file, 
""In addition, your file I/O format shouldn't be the same as the comma separated format from HW8."" 
--- since a comma isn't allowed, is an arrow like ""-&gt;"" okay? 	Why would it be in an incorrect format if the only way to write to it is through the game itself?	If the new format we write can not be in the same comma separated format as in HW08, can it be separated by some other key/character?

Additionally, are we prohibited from using String.split? Is this what it means for Java having a library for parsing? 	There is a note in the File I/O section that says our file I/O format shouldn't be the same as the comma separated format from HW8 - is it sufficiently different if a) it uses a character other than a comma and b) the item after the colon is an int instead of a String so the code has to parse the int into a String and error check for cases where an int is not inputted?	The instructions say that I have to create my own text file format in which Java cannot have a library for parsing this format. Does this mean I cannot separate each data in my file by a new line or a space?"

In .equals method, can all the objects use .equals method? And when we are using .equals method, it does not matter if one of the objects is null, it will just return false, right? And for objects, this "".equals"" method checks for referential equality, right?

"	What value is a thick or thin line? Is this at our discretion?

Also, what is the default line thickness?	My checkbox is working (tested via lightbulb) and I have invoked the line width by using add_change_listener and have updated everything in my repaint and paint_action to account for thickness. However, the thickness is not changing when I click my checkbox. Is this something wrong with my value_controller?	I had the same question but wouldn't you want to update the thickness state in paint.ml, so the change listener of type 'a -&gt; unit could take in the value controller value and then you would update the thickness state with that value controller value. However, this is not working.	I've been having a lot of trouble with this checkbox.
When thick lines is activated as soon as you start drawing a line or ellipse (once you're in drag mode) everything changes thickness including all the border on different widgets. I have no idea why given I basically followed the exact same implementation that was used for color. 
I.e. adding a thickness to the state for paint and having a thickness parameter in with params, with_thickness fxn for the gctx that assigns a line thickness etc. 

Second issue:
My checkbox toggles in that the X goes away or comes back, but it itself won't change the state of paint for some reason. I can't get it to adjust whether the lines are thick or thin. It does perform perfectly in lightbulb however, so it must be a paint issue .	I'm currently trying to implement the last part of Task 5, and have the following code (the bolded line which won't compile because the arguments for add_change_listener aren't the right ones:

let (w_check, vc_check) = checkbox false ""Thick""

let thick_check () : unit =   if paint.thickness = Normal then paint.thickness &lt;- Thick else paint.thickness &lt;- Normal

;; vc_check.add_change_listener (mouseclick_listener thick_check)

How do we pass in the mouseclick_listener as an argument into the value controller? 	How do you go about setting only the things you draw to have thick lines? I'm confused because isn't the line thickness a property of everything that is drawn by default, because it is part of the Graphics library?	I have passes the widget test for checkboxes, and I try to implement thickness now.
I guess I should be using ""add_change_listener"" in the paint.ml, but I don't understand how to use it. And I am especially confused with what bool value it should take in?	I guess I understand the logic of checkbox, but I still don't know how exactly I should implement the thickness checkbox in the paint.ml.	My checkbox works great, passing all the tests and implementing the lightbulb class effectively but for some reason it won't change the line thickness. Any advice on this? 	When I toggle my checkbox, it changes the thickness of everything that's already been drawn, instead of just setting up the thickness of the next thing I want to draw. Where do I begin to find the cause of this? It seems like the thickness value is being applied to everything right now.	In declaring the thickness type, I was wondering if an int ref would be the most efficient way to store the thickness (I chose it because of its similarity to color and I also wanted it to be mutable). Would there be a better way to implement the thickness type?	I have the issue of my borders becoming thick too. I checked @1657 and @1704 but didn't quite understand what it meant by only setting a specific gctx thick instead of globally. Just llke color, should we change the current state (paint's) thickness? By doing so, however, it would still affect the border. Bit lost as to how to fix the issue :( 	Gotcha! But isn't the current state's thickness controlled by paint.thickness? 

(** Thick Lines checkbox *)
let (w_thickcheck, vc_thickcheck) = checkbox false ""Line Thickness"" 
let w_thick : widget = border w_thickcheck

;; vc_thickcheck.add_change_listener 
(fun (b: bool) -&gt; if b then paint.thickness &lt;- thick 
                  else paint.thickness &lt;- thin)
I essentially implemented like this, as the color button changes paint.color. How would I change the specific graphic context's current thickness? (I can only pass one argument into the change listener) 	Do we still need to add the thickness parameters into point though since with params will also take in thickness and draw_points uses with with_params?	I've been implementing thickness into the paint file and I added it to the gctx but my lightbulb also doesn't pop up and I haven't made any changes to the widget file since that last worked	My checkbox was initially working by updating the thickness state in the paint.ml which was a bool. However, a TA told me it would be easier if this thickness state was of type int in the case of my thickness slider. However, isn't the change listener a function of 'a -&gt; unit which means the thickness checkbox can only add change listener of type bool -&gt; unit. This means I cannot update a state that is of type int for my thickness checkbox. Can someone clarify this for me? Thank you! 	So I successfully implemented thickness checkbox with a thickness state in paint that is a bool and set the graphic line thickness to 7 in Gctx.ml if my thickness state is true. I am trying to create another paint state that is of type int that deals with the specific thickness number because of my thickness slider. However, how can I override the 7 if I already stated that the thickness should be 7 when the thickness state is true?
	I'm confused what we are to pass in instead of is_on.contents for the actual thickness checkbox. I don't understand what function we are to pass in. 
	My lightbulb works, and I have tried to implement the changing line thickness similar to the implementation of color, but I can't seem to get the lines to be drawn thick... If someone could point me in the right direction, I would really appreciate it.	I have looked, but most comments say to either handle thickness like color or to add a change listener. I have done both of these (I think), but I'm not sure if the area I'm going wrong in is in my implementation of thickness in Gctx or in Paint.	Hi i have had 2 bugs for the past few hours and could not figure out why they have been occurring
1.My slider is working in reverse and as it moves to the right i thought i made it such that the value would increase but it is decreasing which i cannot understand
2. I only use a line thickness derived from the slide value when the checkbox for thickness is on however this does not seem to be working quite right as the line thickness value resets but it can still be modified by the slider-even though i nested all the conditions where the slide counter value would be used for thickness when the checkbox is on so i do not understand how that is happening.
If someone could help me with one or both of these i would really appreciate it!!!	I added a thickness state to paint, but when I call on paint.thickness, I get an error. Is there any reason why this would be happening?	I implemented thickness as an int, and I am trying to follow the structure of color.  Does this mean my ellipse and line drawers will now have to take in thickness as an argument? I want to make sure I am following the right path before I change all of my code.	can we use mouseclick listener and add_change_listener for putting the thickness checkbox in paint? if no, how do we register when somebody clicks the thickness checkbox? I'm not sure why I am getting an error when doing this... 	In paint, I've added a paint.thickness field and set line witdh to paint.thickness in the with_params function. 
The thickness functionality works fine with lines and ellipses, however, whenever I draw a thick shape, my toolbars are also redrawn with thick borders. 

I understand that this is a scoping issue, but I am not able to figure out what exactly the problem is because with_params is never called in the code to draw color toolbar (all of which was already given)	I'm having the problem that after my thick checkbox is clicked, whenever a line or ellipse is drawn, all of the widget borders (so the color indicators) also change thickness. A TA tried to help me at OH and checked the following:
Thickness not set to 0Thickness being stored in shapes themselvesThickness is being updated correctly with_paramsThe issues discussed in @1861 @1657 @1704
Help please!	should we add thickness to the point constructor, or only to ellipse and line? If points doesn't take in a thickness argument, should we make the thickness argument we add in with_param optional? Otherwise, with_param would take in gctx, color, and thickness, but points don't have a thickness, how do we call it on points?	I added ellipses and began adding the checkbox and thickness but commented it out when it wasn't compiling. 	if you're changing the thickness of the line that's going to be drawn shouldn't it be mutable similar to color? I also tried making it immutable but the error still appeared	Is it okay if I make it so that if the thickness is the original size (1) when the thick lines button is unchecked, and only when the thick lines button is checked does the slider impacts the thickness?	I've gotten my shapes to be thin at the beginning and thick when the box is checked, but when I uncheck the box the shapes are still thick when I create them. This is what I input for the add_change_listener 
fun b -&gt; if paint.thickness = thin         then paint.thickness &lt;- thick         else paint.thickness &lt;- thin
and I've tried a bunch of variations using b but nothing really solves the problem so I'm not sure if it's just a problem in another area of my code?	I have implemented thickness in every file but for some reason the button won't turn itself off and I don't know where this would be coming from. Another issue is that it makes all of the borders in the program thick when it is on.

Any help/idea why this is?

I implemented thickness throughout paint/gtcx.ml/gtxc.mli and I believe it should all work. The ""thick line"" button appears where it should on the window, and when I press it an ""X"" appears. however it does not change the thickness of the line. I assume that problem stems from the above code. However I don't know where I am making a mistake. 	I am trying to create a thickness slider, but I don't know how to set the thickness to the current slider value. In paint.ml I have written the w_thickslider implementation, but I cannot set paint.thickness to any number other than the numbers I have defined as ""thick"" and ""thin."" How to I fix this?

Is there any way to fix it?	When I add a thickness argument to with_params function for task 5, it tells me that the constructior thickness does not exist. However I defined thickness type in gctx file and in its interface. 

What can be wrong?	I'm confused about where to update the value of the checkbox with a new thickness. I managed to implement the checkbox into paint and clicking on it in the tool bar will toggle whether or not it's checked but nothing happens because I never update the thickness.

Also, I don't quite exactly remember where we learned ""with.""  Could I be pointed to a place in the lecture notes where its functionality is explained? 	For my slider function I had it input a gctx so that I could make the slider any color. How do you access the color of this inputted gctx because g.color (g is the name of the gctx) is coming up with an error?"

"	i'm noticing that a lot of the homework problems advise us to use referential equality. why is this necessary? my code seem sto work fine using structural equality	Why are we using structural equality for delete but referential for other things like truncate?	Hi, 

Some of my tests for delete_last are reporting 'out of memory' errors...I know the FAQ suggests that this may be because I am incorrectly checking for structural equality, but the instructions for this function explicitly say to use structural equality. 	i understand that the choice of referential equality defined the behavior, but i think where I'm getting lost is elt meant to be a node itself or is it a possible value for v within the node?	In the FAQ, it says out of memory errors are usually caused by structural equality checks, but I don't do any structural equality checks in reverse. Any hints?	I am confused why referential equality is needed in truncate for simple queue. If we are working within a list, and create a new list for q.data to reference, what does structural equality miss? Since my current function that only uses structural equality passes all my tests, I think I'm missing something about the basic structure of the SimpleQueue. I saw @898 and @855 but I'm still confused as to why these apply to Simple Queue.

Also, I used ints for my tests, because thats what the examples did. However, is there a difference between using primitive types and things on the heap when testing queues?	Why does delete_last in deque tell us to use structural instead of referential inequality?	Like I know I can assign q.head or q.tail to None or Some n, but wouldn't assigning it to Some n not preserve referential equality?	No, I'm using referential equality. Also, code works with bools.	In my LinkedQueue, I have an error labeled 
""delete structural equality"".
What does this refer to? i.e. does it refer to structural equality within the delete function? Or does it ask me to physically delete a structural equality.	I used structural equality, but it doesn't work.	Will putting a new Pixel frequency into a ColorMap use referential equality or structural equality to determine if the key already exists?

For example, say I have two Pixels in a bitmap that refer to separate instances, but have the same color. If I put both of these pixels into a ColorMap, will both fall under the same key or will they represent different keys?	As a rule of thumb, the professor in the class said you should just use structural equality for primitives and referential for non-primitives. Why is this? Would it produce an error otherwise?	for the following:
let x = 1 in
let y = x in
let z = y

is z == x true? In other words, what's the scope to which referential equality checks if two references point to the same heap value?	I still do not understand the logic for the first part of this question. You say that "" f they have referential equality, they must be the same object"", and I agree with this. However, the answer key says that the answer is false which means that s.equals(t) is not necessarily true even if s == t.

I do not understand how this is possible. Can you provide an example of a situation where two variables have referential equality but not structural equality? Is the answer key simply wrong?	I think this is java, but that was a superb explanation of OCaml structural equality! 	Hi, I appreciate your answer, and I really want to come up with a function in which structural equality and referential equality will make a difference, but I kind of don't know how to think this- it's like, I know what they are and what's their differences, but I don't know how to put them to use- In what circumstances/function/method will this different equality matters?	I know that we typically aren't supposed to use structural or referential equality to compare options and that we typically pattern match.

However, I wanted to understand why this is the case by drawing the memory diagram. Is this correct?

Also, does this mean that Some x==Some x returns False, while Some x = Some x returns True?	what is the equivalent for structural and referential equality when using primitives in Java	For 1e, in the if statement after
| Some m -&gt; 
does it matter if we use structural or referential equality when comparing m and n?
	Sorry I have a question about the previous follow-up question about whether we should use referential equality or structural equality when comparing m and n:

TA mentioned that using structural equality might result in infinite loop, but I thought it might end the loop earlier, because structural equality is easier to find than a stricter referential equality? Why can it result in infinite loop?

And also, in comparing the qnodes, referential equality means it should point to the same node in ASM, but for structural equality, I know the value should be the same, and the prev and next should also point to the same place as the qnode we are compared to, right???	Shouldn't it be s.equals(t) instead of s = t? Isn't s = t still referential equality?
	in the line ""if old_next == None"", can you test for referential equality between a type 'a option and None?, won't this always return false because you don't know if they are pointing to the same None on the heap. Would it be more accurate to test for structural equality or pattern match old_next to None and Some x	I am bit confused why if s and t are String and s == t, s.equals(t) wouldn't be true.
I remember reading on one of the TA's notes on the Midterm Review material that referential equality implies structural equality. Since strings are objects s == t would test for the referential equality, not the structural equality, while s.equals(t) would test for structural equality. So following the logic of referential equality implying structural equality, if s == t is true shouldn't s.equals(t) also be true?	Can you clarify if this is right?

In OCaml, double equals is referential equality and single equal is structural equality.

In Java, if we are comparing primitives, double equals checks for structural equality, while with objects, it checks for referential equality.	While comparing m and n, why do we check for referential equality? Shouldn't we check for structural? how do we know that they point to the same some bubble?	

Why wouldn't structural equality q1=q2 cause the program to go into an infinite loop? Would referential equality cause the program to go into an infinite loop? How do you compare collections (using .equals()) in java?"

Okay a couple questions about this:

(1)
SO starting with d. — I'm not sure kind of what this questions is asking in general...
(2)
For e., I know that the whole ""this.X"" sort of thing allows for private variables in constructors to be named certain things like block(String x, int y) {this.x = name; this.y = 3} but I don't know what ""C.m( )"" really means.
(3)
For f., does anyone know in general what happens if we do something like int A = 3; (double) A? Because then that changes ""A"" to 3.0 so both statically and dynamically it is A now, right? Or like Cat cat 1 = new Animal( ) where Cat is an Animal ... so what would recasting a ""Cat"" look like... and in this case Cat would be the static type and Animal would be the dynamic type?	If Cat is a subtype of Animal and you do Cat a = new Animal(), what type of error is it?"
"	when implementing set_of_list, should we be using a helper function?"
"	It was suggested that we use something like
let points =
   begin match paint.preview with
   | Some (Points (_, ps)) -&gt; ps

   end in
to get the parameters needed before adding a shape with those parameters to the deque. Is there anything wrong with just getting the whole shape from the preview to insert into the deque?"

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.	I'm a little confused in file corrector constructor on how to use a buffered reader because it takes in a reader. Any suggestions?	I created a file to use in my dictionary test cases, but it seems that I'm having trouble getting the path correct.

File file = new File(""/User/calebblackburn/Workspace_eclipse/SpellCheck/src/DictionaryHelp.txt"");
then the file is null. The file does have text in it, so it doesn't have anything to do with the file being empty. What should I do to fix this?

Thanks	I made a new txt file with some of the cases that I want to test getCorrections with.  Every line has a comma, but every test using that file is triggering an invalid input exception which I throw when a line does not have a comma.  All of the tests that I wrote using the provided SmallMispellings.txt are passing, so I feel like it might be some problem with my file.  Any ideas?	I am passing all of the tests that were given in DictionaryTest; however, for every test that I wrote in MyTests, I get a FileNotFoundException when I test using a text file that I created (i.e. I fail tests for ""The dictionary file contains a blank line in the middle."") I'm not really sure what the issue is or if I just created the text files the wrong way.	So I made an empty dictionary file for my testing, and when make is called on an empty file, should there be an IOException thrown, or is that allowed?

If that isn't one way to throw an IOException, what might be one way that I can test that the make function is working properly in that case?	for dictionary and specifically when DictionaryTest calls files/smallDictionary.txt where do I find this file? 	Since the buffered reader class doesn't have a hasNext() function, how should we iterate over throgh over the lines of text in the argued text file?  I want to create a while loop and read in each line but am not sure how I would do so.  	For file corrector, my tests work, except when I have to access text below a line break (blank line) in the file. I tried to handle it in my constructor but I keep getting the same error even though I feel like it should be handled.

	I want to update write out my updated highscores to a separate textfile, but before I write it out, I want to get rid of the existing text in the file. How would I do this?	If you begin writing to a file that already has text in it, does it begin at the end of the text, or does it erase the pre-existing text? Thanks. 	Does it automatically start at a new line? Couldn't find that on that java docs; all it said is that it starts at the end of the file. Thanks!	Is it OK if our instructions are just a .txt file in our project? Or are they supposed to be something that the user accesses while the game is running? Thanks!	I am getting the same error. Here is my file structure:

Not sure what is wrong since the Game.java file is clearly present...	I want to make a slight change in my game proposal and I wanted to get your approval.

I'm implementing Minesweeper, and originally I decided to use 2-D arrays, Collections, File I/O, and JUnit Testing. However, I changed my game design to implement 2-D arrays, Collections, JUnit Testing, and Recursion. With this change, I am planning to use recursion to find the neighboring blank squares instead of inputting a text file as a pause/resume game feature.

My game design still uses 4 of the key concepts required by the homework assignment. Is this change okay? I've already made my game already (with the exception of JUnit Testing) which includes these 4 concepts so it definitely should work fine. Do I have to submit another game proposal or anything?	I am confused on what to do once you read in the text file, parse through, and use writer. Once you have that text file that the writer wrote out with updated scores, do you read through that updated file to get that information and show it to the players? This seems counterproductive. 	What do you mean by complex enough? Also, I have a text file that updates and displays the highest score, will I get full credit for Java I/O?	I am creating ConnectFour and if I want to use File I/O to allow users to save games and reload them at another time, is it okay if it can only save one game at a time? or should it be able to store the state of many games? 	Are we allowed to do more than 4 concepts and then list all of them on the README.txt file so that if one of the concepts isn't implemented properly we can still get full credit on the project.	The website says that ""If you use a collection in your I/O concept (e.g. a list to store all of the high scores that you read), you cannot count this use of collections for the ""Appropriately modeling state using collections"" concept"", but I'm confused.

I am storing objects in two data structures and I'd like to save the current state in a file, so that the user can load the game from a certain point. Does this mean that, since I am going to save them in a file, I can't count the use of the two data structures for the ""modeling state using collections"" concept? I am confused because my proposal didn't receive a feedback saying if I can/can't.	For hw6 I just put the entire file path.  But I think the difference is that for hw6, the compiler/grader wasn't depending on the files I'm turning in, they had a copy of their own.  Also, the file path was only to allow the tests to work, not the program itself.

I'm guessing using the whole file path, which is personalized to my computer, won't work?  Is there anyway to have java look just one folder above the program?  (eg, ""./files/"" --which isn't working for me..)	I'm trying to display the leaderboard on my game, and I want something like:

Player1 50
Player2 30
Player3 10

But right now it's displaying as 
Player1 50    Player2 30   Player3 10

Every time the game ends I'm reading my txt file and converting it into a string, and I'm using the \n command in between lines but it doesn't seem to be working. Is there any other way I can directly display the scores txt file in my game?	if we are using I/O to save and load games, do we need to handle the event in which the file name does not exist? (do we need to handle FileNotFoundExceptions?)	Hi, I made some changes, and I realized I should not have call 
out = new FileOutputStream (new File (""files/NameScoreFile""));
every time I call the writeToFile method, so now I wrote
 try {			out = new FileOutputStream (new File (""files/NameScoreFile""));		} catch (FileNotFoundException e1) {			e1.printStackTrace();		}
in my GameCourt (I have a private field of FileStreamOutput out in the GameCourt), before I even initialize my game board. 

But now, the problem is that, I still cannot write the record to file of the second round of game because I'm getting exceptions:
java.io.IOException: Stream Closed	at java.io.FileOutputStream.writeBytes(Native Method)	at java.io.FileOutputStream.write(FileOutputStream.java:313)	at MoleGameCourt.writeToFile(MoleGameCourt.java:207)
I understand now I close my stream after the first round of record, but if I'm gonna change that, It seems like I should not even close my stream, because we can never know if the game at hand is the user's last round of game though. Can you please give me some tip on how and where I should close my stream? Thank you so much.	I'm confused on what I can/can't use for the File I/O section. My objective is to read/write a save state file for my game. The textfile will contain numbers which I will translate into objects in my game.

What classes/methods can I use?
i.e. Can I use FileReader, BufferedReader or Scanner and their methods? Besides the function of converting from text to my game state, I am confused on what uniqueness I am expected to contribute	for the main argument for SpellCheckRunner- should that be put into Game.java? obviously after I rewrite it for my file io	Another question is that, since in the file I write my record to only follows the style I want it to be, so can I not handle the cases when the file is not the way it is supposed to be? Or are we required to do that? 	Just want to check that it is ok to use PrintWriter to write the state of my game board into a text file along with the player's username as a way of saving the game status? I still use a unique design for saving values in my text file in which the username and game board state is separated with dollar signs and each state of the cells in my game board is separated by white space hyphen white space (cell type, whether cell is flagged, whether it is covered), and I manually parse it based on my defined parsers when I read the file using BufferedReader. 	How detailed does the ReadMe file have to be? Should it just discuss the 4 design concepts we implemented + changes we've made, or do we have to explain our class structure, what each class does, method functionality + logic as well?

 	My game is connect 4, and I want to load game state from a file. I'm planning on having a file that contains a bunch of consecutive numbers. I'm gonna interpret the numbers in triplets, where the first 2 numbers are the xy coordinates of a coin that was on the board when the game was saved, and the 3rd number indicates which player the coin belonged to.

Does this count as keeping track of 2 pieces of state?

What happens if the invariants require that the document is always properly formatted? For example, if I was trying to save a game, I would write the file in a certain format when it's saved, so that when I load the game and read the file, it must be in that format.

I have accounted for an IOException in a try catch block with a print statement stating the error. Is that sufficient?	Hi, you said this requirement refers to if the input from the player is right or not, but if I handled the wrongly-entered username in the listener of the button in the JOption instead of in the File I/O, does that count? Or am I required to handle the wrongly entered username only in File I/O?	My game is brick breaker. I'm trying to make my game be able to save and resume. When I save, I write to a file where the bricks should appear. When I resume, I pass in this file (instead of the usual file levels I pass in in the reset method) so that the bricks position saved could re appear. However, no bricks are appearing on the screen. However, the balls do appear. I don't understand why this is happening when I create a new brickmap in resume method. What am I doing wrong?

"	Every method in problems 1 to 4 has the recursion modifier in front of it.  Do we need to use recursion for every problem or can we submit answers without recursion?	I had a follow up question for the same question.I cannot figure out how to stop the recursion after the list has been traversed once.So this is my current main pattern match

Now the issue I'm facing is that this recursion will go on forever. Since first element keeps on getting joined to the list at every call. In java to stop a recursion I sometimes used a depth argument in the recursive function. So my question is that is it permitted to add another ""input"" argument to the permutations function?
	I see the problem with them, but is there a way for me to stop the recursion from going all the way to the end or check if the element is a leaf?

Are we allowed to use the combine function? 	Will we lose points for not using tail calls when working with queues and dequeues, or are we only required to use tail call recursion on to_list in dequeue? Thanks.	Will tail recursion be on the midterm?	Hi y'all,

So Janani and I were a little bit confused about the four different questions featured below. 

The first one compares (String) .equals() versus ==. The thing is, if ""=="" requires both elements to point to the same thing in the heap, then shouldn't that ""thing"" be one value, thus meaning "".equals()"" also checks for that same equality?
The third one involves a loop that *we thought* ran endlessly. When we enter in ""10,"" it should never equal 0, right? Meaning we will never have an instance where the ""then"" is called; always ""else""... right?
The last one involves a question about tail recursion. The thing is, if we're always cons-ing on an element to another list, doesn't that mean that the end of the function above will have to ""collect"" all of its elements at the very end and spit out a list? That doesn't sound like tail recursion to me. Any sort of guidance or help on why it might be tail recursion would be much appreciated.

Muchas gracias.

CIS120.PNG	Hi, thanks for your answers, but I have 2 more followups:

1. I read through the textbook, and I think I understand tail recursion, but I'm still a little unsure - can you explain a little how to discern a tail recursion from a traditional recursion? I would really appreciate this! 

2. I understand that their representation on ASM won't be tested, but can you also explain a little why it takes less space, I read the book but I don't get it - is it because it updates the stack instead of storing the values again and again?\

Thank you so much!	So when both of these two recursions go into infinite loops, the traditional recursion will produce ""StackOverFlow"" because it takes up some space every time it loops, and will eventually use up all the stack space; while the tail recursion will simply keep the program running without producing a result, because it takes a constant space, so it won't overflow, it will just keep on running, right?

Just wanna make sure my understanding is right. Thanks	In class we talked about how we can identify if something is tail recursion if the workspace is not saved. Why did we save the workspace in this code when there was not an additional processing step?	Does tail recursion mean that all function calls need to not save a workspace?

What if most function calls did not save a workspace, but a few do (using an if else statement)? Would this be considered tail recursive?	Can you check if my reasoning is right?The following function is not tail-recursive because in the else statement, you are consing on hd to the value of the recursion which uses up stack space.

"	I'm a bit confused by the first test case for dequeue in problem 4. I understand that q is initialized as an empty queue, and that calling deq on q should remove the head of the queue and return the head if it exists.

However, because this q is empty, I don't understand how ""removing the head of the queue"" would work, and why running is_empty on q should return false. Is this because we are violating the invariants of a queue (in that it has a head and tail?)	Is the only way to identify the head value of the queue to pattern match on q.head? I know you can't do q.head.v.	I think I figured out how to do it without reversing it. I created a helper function that takes in the whole queue and made it recurse on a new queue with the head.next as the new head pointer. And it works with all the test cases as well. It might be more inefficient but you don't have to reverse the list at the same time. It's fine if I use this for my deque implementation right?	Also, is there a way to assign q.head to a particular qnode option, like n.next--would I have to say either q.head &lt;- n.next or q.head &lt;- Some n.next?	For my deque delete_last function, all of my conditions are passing except for the condition where the only match in the deque is the head (so the function would remove the head and make the new head the node after head); I feel like my logic is right but something isn't working there. I would really appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction.	Where in the code does it set head's next pointer to be some of itself? I can't pinpoint the line where the code instructs the head's next pointer to be set at all. 	

I'm a little confused about why the next pointer for v = 2 points to itself rather than the head. In the second match case,
Some n -&gt;new_node.next &lt;- Some n;
Aren't we matching on q.head? If so, why doesn't new_node.next point to q.head. "

while I get how to store stuff within the function generally, when I try to store add_change_listener, I end up storing ('a -&gt; unit) -&gt; unit as opposed to just the 'a -&gt; unit part.  I then am not sure how to separate and apply the 'a-&gt; unit part (I get the warning that it's a partial application).

If I store add_change_listener to a  (('a -&gt; unit) -&gt; unit) list, how do I get the 'a -&gt; unit part?  Thanks for your help.	 I am very confused regarding the make_controller for task 5. We should be adding change_listeners (i.e. functions) to a list. However add_change_listener has type ('a -&gt; unit) -&gt; unit. This does not include space to update a list (e.g. ('a -&gt; unit) list -&gt; unit). Likewise, the construction of a value_controller doesn't have an instance variable where we can store the value (which becomes a problem when we try to change the value in change_value). How can one work around these issues?

"	Hello,

I'm a little confused by the instructions: 

""You also need to modify the function associated with the Undo button to reset the paint.preview shape toNone. In addition, if the paint.mode is LineEndMode, then reset it to LineStartMode—this prevents strange behavior when the user starts drawing a line, drags the mouse off the canvas, and then clicks the Undo button.""

Should this last part also be implemented in the undo function? 	For the undo function: if I drag the line off the canvas and click undo should it get rid of the previewed line and the line drawn before hand? 	I changed the state if LineEndMode, and am still getting the same error where it deletes 2 lines when I undo. I am supposed to implement this in the undo method correct?	I am also having this problem. Why are my undo and quit buttons not working?	My undo button works, but after completing task 3, I can't draw any points. I can only draw lines. My quit buttons also does not work. How do I fix this problem?	The undo() function is defined in Paint.ml as:

let undo () : unit =  if Deque.is_empty paint.shapes then () else    ignore (Deque.remove_tail paint.shapes)

What is the purpose of the reserved word ignore?
	What should the undo function be doing when in PointMode?	Ok that fixed it! Now I can drag points across the screen and undo it accordingly. But there's still the problem of having to click undo twice to remove an individually placed point. Why is this happening?	Above undo () , it says 
(* TODO: You need to modify this in Task 3 and 4. *)

What different behavior needs to be implemented for Task 3? Without any changes paint seems fine deleting the last points shape when undo is clicked. 	None of why buttons work when I click on them and I cannot figure out why. The buttons that were given (Undo, Quit) do not work either. What can be the problem?	So I implementing an undo button for my 2048 game using a linked list and its functions as it should in most scenarios. Only one situation seems to fail, when you undo after a move is performed right after a previous undo. Once you click undo again, though, it continues to work but skipping the first attempted undo. Any errors I should be looking out for?	If I load my game from a file, do I have to be able to undo the moves that produced the state represented by the file?	If we choose to make an undo button using collections, does the undo button have to change the state to exactly how it was the move before?

For example, in 2048 could the undo button change the state to an array with the same values as before but rotated a random number of times?	I am implementing a ConnectFour. I was wondering if, after I save, I am allowed to make it that you can no longer undo moves prior to the save. For example, when you re-open a Microsoft Word Doc that you previously saved and closed, you cannot undo actions from before, but you can still undo actions from the time you opened the document again and until you save and close again. Thank you!	Hi, my minesweeper works fine for all the functions. However, when I added the undo function, the whole panel stalls, no Jbutton or cells could be clicked/reacting to my request and I could not even click the red exit button or the orange minimize window size button. Then I tried to comment out all the code I have for the undo, but the game does not start working. Is there anything I could look for to change??? Thanks! 

(ps. I tried to store the game state in a linkedlist called linkedlist&lt;Cell[][]) moves.  nothing can move right now

compared to I could successfully get the winning/losing before adding undo()

Hello! I was trying to test my undo function when there is no move to undo (throws a NoSuchElementException) but the test doesn't pass :( Is there something wrong with my syntax? 	Currently I employ both saving and undo functionalities in my Minesweeper game. Undo as in a user removing his/her moves, and saving as in saving the current game state and reloading when the user wants to continue. Currently, a user can only ""undo"" his moves once he has started making new moves even in a game that was previously loaded. i.e, the reloading functionality works in a way right now that it reloads the previous state of the game but the moves the user made in that previous game cannot be manipulated. If the game that was reloaded had 2 flagged cells from the previous game, the user cannot unflag those cells from the previous game. HOwever, if the user chooses to flag a 3rd cell, the user would be able to undo that move. Is this ok if I explain the restriction in my ReadMe? 	Should the user be able to undo after the game is ""over""	Is it necessary to reduce the score if someone ""undo"" their actions or is that up to us as well?"

"	Dear y'all!

What is a pixel? I've created three private instance variables ""r"" ""g"" and ""b"" and then constructed the first ""Pixel"" that takes in (int r, int g, int b) into a sort of this.r = r fashion. But is a pixel supposed to be an array of three numbers? A ""triplet"" of ints? A nine-digit integer like 200255199? I'm confused as to how I'm supposed to manipulate the inputs of (int r, int g, int b) int code.

Any help appreciated!

	Ahh, got it.

Would instantiating an array outside of &lt;&lt; Pixel(int r, int g, int b) &gt;&gt;, then filling the array inside fulfill the needs of constructing Pixel successfully?

Also... I wondering if the concept of ""triplets"" exist in Java ~
	The functions:

Pixel(int[] c)Pixel(int r, int g, int b)
What exactly are they returning?	I'm still not understanding what were supposed to return within the 
Pixel (int r, int g, int b) and Pixel (int [] c) functions? 

Wouldn't you be calling  
int [] rgb = {10, 20, 30};
Pixel p = new Pixel (10, 20, 30)

outside of these functions? 



	What is supposed to happen if the array sent in is empty? Or if it has more than three elements? 
Pixel(int[] c)

 	If we choose to implement pixel as an array of length 3, how do we make it immutable? Can we declare it as a final int array or would this not work??	I'm getting a failure during submission saying something about immutability. I'm kind of stuck, as I'm not sure what isn't correct. I don't have any set methods, just the constructor so there shouldn't be a way to alter the pixel components after it has been constructed. Any thoughts? Btw clip() is just a helper function to correct out of bounds pixel components. Do I need the final keyword somewhere or something? Relevant code:
    /* Components of pixel in form of array, where first index is red, second is blue, third is green */    private int[] comps = new int[3];        Pixel(int r, int g, int b) {        // TODO: Implement this    	comps[0] = clip(r);    	comps[1] = clip(g);    	comps[2] = clip(b);    }        public int[] getComponents() {
        return comps; 
    }
	Just wondering if I am allowed to change the Pixel Constructor variables from 
Pixel(int r, int g, int b)
to
Pixel(int x, int y, int z)
I had written a bunch of code already using the r, g, b variables and don't want to have to replace them with different names. However, I don't want this change to mess up any tests that run upon submission."

"	Hello. I was working on implementing the channels on ServerModel and was a little hesitant on picking a data structure to represent it. I understand a channel has a name, an owner, an invite-only feature, and a list of joined users. Because there are so many elements, it's probably difficult to use a tree map. I was looking for some guidance on how to represent the channel. I was thinking of perhaps implementing a map within a map, or some other nested data structure implementation. Any hints or advice would be appreciated.	From a design perspective, does it make sense to treat a particular channel as a Linked List/Tree, where index 0/root is the owner and everyone else is a member?This could be implemented as a class or simply as a collection within ServerModel.So is implementing every channel as a new collection a good idea, and if so, is it better to do it from within a collection in ServerModel or as a separate class?

My biggest concern with both of these way is that data can go out of sync. If a user disconnects, I will have to check to every single channel and ensure the user is removed from all of them. Doing this if every channel exists as a collection within ServerModel would be a bother, so this leads me to believe that I should create a channel class. Once all the channels are stored in a collection within ServerModel I can run a for-each loop and remove the disconnected user from every channel.So, I am not sure if I'm on the right track or not.

Another idea I have is to disregard everything above, and simply add a linked list field to my User class which currently stores the id and nickname. I can simply add channels to linked list of a user when the user joins a channel. When the user is deregistered, the user's channel bindings are deleted along with the user. This way all the data is stored in the main collection of users inside ServerModel. The potential issue I can see with this is when I have to send a message to all users of a particular channel, I will have to go through every single user in the main registeredUsers collections, find who all is a part of the selected channel and send a message to them. This will be very slow.I am sorry for the wall of text but I am extremeley unsure of what path to take next.	Whoops, guess I didn't read close enough. Thanks!

So... when deleting the channel do we need to broadcast this change to each respective client? Or is changing the servers internal state enough? I'm thinking if I just remove the channel from my data structure then my client and server will be out of sync.	does the deregisterUser function have to handle deleting a channel if the deregistered user is the owner of the channel? or is that just the leave command?	Should the users within that channel that is destroyed be notified that user who owns the channel has deregistered?	Finally, we are ready to implement the actual messaging part of the server! When a user sends a message to a channel, it should be relayed (via an okay Broadcast) to all clients in that channel. You should keep in mind that no part of the server model needs to change for message delivery; you should rely on it only for error condition checking.


What does it mean when the directions says ""no part of the server model needs to change for message delivery""? Are we not supposed to create a new method in SeverModel like we do for other commands?	I was wondering if someone could look at my code, because I can't seem to figure out what's going wrong with my commands. Currently, I am failing testJoinChannelExistsNotMember, testLeaveChannelExistsMember, and 
testDeregisterSendsDisconnectedWhereMember. I commented out all of the test cases to just focus on testJoinChannelExistsNotMember.

I realize that the join channel test first creates channel called when an owner called User0. Then the test adds User1 to the channel. Through several print statements, I have deduced that only the owner is being added to the channel. However, when I test my getJoinedUsers() method in my Channel class, it returns both users. But when I try to print out the users in the channel via my join method (which calls getJoinedUsers() in ServerModel, it is only printing out User0 and not User0 and User1. I have pasted my code into codio. Any guidance would be appreciated.	I feel like I am confused with how to use information stored in another class.
I want to create a class for channels.
If I have a static field in channel class which is a list of channelnames, can I directly call it with Channel.*** in ServerModel class?
And how should I deal with the constructors in Channel class and in Server Model Class?	what's an efficient way to compare one channel object with another? It seems inefficient to loop through a channel name and convert each letter to an ascii value, and then compare that int value with the int value of another channel's name.	So to clarify how the model should behave, when a User joins a channel only users already in that channel are notified. When a User tries to join a channel that they're already in then should nobody be notified? 	Does inviting someone to a channel automatically add them to it? If so, it shouldn't be possible for anyone (including those invited) to JOIN an invite-only channel, right? 	I cannot quite understand which Broadcast method I would use for notifying the users that their channel has been deleted?
Broadcast.disconnect seems to only be notifying them about a particular person leaving the channel	if a user that is in only one channel leaves the one channel they are in which is effectively deregistering as I understand it, are we supposed to use the deregister broadcast instead of the leave one?	i'm getting the error public type Channel must be in its own file when I try to make a separate class for channel- how do I fix this?	I'm getting an error saying channel cannot be casted to java.lang.comparable for the channel messages tests. What do these mean? 
	The instruction say 
""the users already present in the channel should be notified that a new user has joined.""

But I don't see anything in broadcast that would do this? Am I missing something?	Hello! I implemented my list of current Channels in the server through a map, where a channel (key) maps to a value (name of Channel). 

private Map&lt;Channel, String&gt; currentChannels;
However, I could have also implemented this by having a private field inside the Channel class called Channel Name. I just chose to do the map because alot of the methods pass the channel name as parameters and it is easier to use a map to find the corresponding Channel. I could have also, however, iterated over a set of channels, find the channel with the corresponding nickname, and do something with it. What are the pros/cons of each approach and which one should I use? 	If create a single instance of a User = User0User0 creates a new channel
When User0 clicks to leave the channel, the console prints out an Illegal Argument Exception 
""Disconnected user in broadcast"" The GUI does not reflect that any change has happened. 

Does the leave button in the GUI automatically also call the deregister command? Does leaving the only channel you are in make you deregistered? Why am I getting this error?

Edit - I understood how to solve this!	am i allowed to have a public method in my server model class that removes a user from a channel and/or that removes a channel from the server? does that break encapsulation?	I created a new class, Channel, but when I use the getters and setters from that class in ServerModel, it gives me errors saying the method is undefined for the type Channel. How do I fix this? 	Suddenly i am also having this issue for both of my constructed classes (Client and Channel).... My project is set to build automatically and i don't think i imported Channel into my ServerModel class. Any ideas for fixes?	recipients - A set of nicknames of the other users in the channel which the user is joining, and to whom the command should be relayed.

Should recipient not include the person that just joined the channel??	In the instructions it says:
""the channel itself should be destroyed""

Is there a way to destroy an object?
or is it considered destroyed if we have removed it from servermodel	I made a channel class that uses a treemap structure but when I try to use .get(key) and .keySet() for .getUserId(String nickname) and .getRegisteredUsers(), I get the error this method is not defined for ServerModel.Channel- how do I rectify this?	If the owner deregisters causing the channels it owns to be gone as well, do we inform the users that were apart of the channel before that the channel is now gone? I can't find any directions for this. 	Does broadcast.names() take care of both sending the existing users in the channel a notification that someone new joined and also sending the new user the names of the existing users? I implement this method when there are no errors in the JoinCommand, but I'm confused if I should also be sending a Broadcast.okay to those that already exist in the channel. 	Then why does the Broadcast names function header say this: 

@param recipients A set of nicknames of the other users in the channel which the user is* joining, and to whom the command should be relayed.

So isn't recipients just the other users, not including the new joiner?	When testing my code where I'm the owner of a channel, leaving the channel does destroy the channel. However, the channel is still visible in the actual 
client itself.  This results in a null pointer exception when I try to do something within a channel (that shouldn't be accessible visually anymore). How do I address this 
visual component?	
 

I am working on the LeaveCommand in Task 4, but I am encountering a problem with the test where two users
join and one leaves. The error is specifically that the person who is still in the channel receives the message,
but the one who leaves does not. I cannot see what is going wrong with my code, since my recipients variable
is initialized and instantiated before I do any changes to the channel. Could you help me figure out where I 
went wrong? Thank you very much for your help.	I have a boolean isPrivate in my channel class, and I want to use this to check if the channel isInviteOnly in JoinCommand's updateServerModel. How do I access the boolean value?	When I run testKickOneChannel, both users are kicked out, as evident by ""num. users in channel expected:&lt;1&gt; but was:&lt;0&gt;"" and the ""User0 still in channel"" test failing. Does anyone have suggestions for this? 	I didn't pass the testLeaveChannelExistsMember and testKickOneChannel.  Also, after I checked all errors (channel doesn't exist, user not in channel)before proceeding to the actual updateModel part, I don't have to check if they're null in my methods in ServerModel anymore, right?	I'm having trouble compiling my files in Codio. I get this error message and I think I may have an issue with my innerclass Channel but I'm not sure?

mkdir binjavac -d bin src/*.javasrc/ServerModel.java:3: error: package ServerModel does not existimport ServerModel.Channel; ^1 errormake: *** [Server] Error 1codio@opinion-oval:~/workspace$	If a user deregisters and he was the only one in a certain channel, do we remove that channel? Or does the channel remain open? What happens if he was the only one in a channel and he leaves?	nick change broadcast to all channels where member: new nick is in first channel

What does this mean? The user with the new nickname was in the first channel?	When I am trying to test that the JoinCommand for a private channel with give an error message, I have a test failure saying that 

java.lang.AssertionError: cannot join private channel expected:&lt;{User3=[:User3 ERROR 407]}&gt; but was:&lt;{User3=[:User3 ERROR 402]}&gt;

What exactly is ERROR 402? I have a User class and a Channel class to keep all the information about Users and Channels, I also used TreeSets to store User objects and Channel objects on ServerModel. I have the code for my test, my code for the Join Command as follows:

Thank you!	I have written the following test code which gives me a concurrentModificationException on the highlighted line:



When I trace this code to serverModel, the error occurs on the following highlighted line:
I read up on when this error usually occurs and it happens when a collection is being modified as it is being iterated upon. From what my understanding is, I don;t think I modify the collection userIsOwnerOf anywhere in the loop itself. In the loop I get all the users of that particular channel and then remove that channel from the individual list of each of the users. Finally I remove the channel from the master list of allChannels. Nowhere is userIsOwnerOf being modified according to my understanding. Why is this error coming then? 

Thanks in advance	Is there a hierarchy to the errors for broadcast.
What if the target isn't a user, the channel is public, and the person sending it isn't the owner? Can any of the three applicable errors be thrown or is there a specific one?

I've run it through on paper countless times, and it seems that it has to work. Can someone help me?	
Am I allowed to let a non-recursive function call a recursive function? For ex. member written with fold in listSet, not allowed to add rec keyword, but I wrote a recursive function called contains.

let member (x: 'a) (s: 'a set) : bool = let rec contains (x: 'a) (s: 'a set) : bool =  begin match s with | [] -&gt; false | hd :: tl -&gt; not (hd &gt; x) &amp;&amp; (x = hd || contains x tl) end in fold (fun v acc -&gt; contains x s || acc) false s	when I try to run my tests for OLSet, it'll output 

--- Running tests for OLSet ---Running: OLSet: is_empty: call on empty returns true ... Test passed!Running: OLSet: is_empty: non-empty set returns false ... clear &amp;&amp; make runSetTest

but then it won't go on- it seems to be stuck there. is it a problem with my set_of_list since that is used in the test case codio is stuck on?

let rec set_of_list (l: 'a list) : 'a set =
    begin match l with
    | [] -&gt; []
    | hd::[] -&gt; [hd]
    | hd::mid::tl -&gt; if hd = mid then set_of_list (mid::tl) 
                     else if hd &gt; mid then set_of_list (mid::hd::tl)
                     else set_of_list (hd::mid::tl)
    end
	Is it still considered tail recursion if you have an if statement and then a single recursive call?

For example, if you had the following recursive function that checked if any elements in a list were equal to 5, would it be considered tail recursion since it doesn't seem to be significantly growing the stack?

| [] -&gt; false
| hd::tl -&gt; if hd = 5 then true
else fun tl	For this question, the answer key says the best answer is:
let rec shortest_aux (ss : string list) : string * int =
begin match ss with
| [] -&gt; failwith ""need at least one""
| __[hd]__ -&gt; ___ (hd, String.length hd) ___
| (hd :: tl) -&gt;
let len = String.length hd in
__let p = shortest_aux tl in __________
__if (len &lt;= snd p) ____________________________
__then (hd, len) ______________________________
__else p ______________________________
end
How does p know to format itself into (string, int or len) format when we haven't declare it; that is, p is calling on a recursion but we have not informed the recursion what to return yet. In addition, could we use the min/max functions here?


Also, is there suggestions on where we can test if we our answers work on the ocaml interface (without trying to run the code in our homework?)	let rec separate (v:int) (lst : int list) : int list * int list =begin match lst with| [] -&gt; ([],[])| hd :: tl -&gt;let (xs,ys) = separate v tl inif hd &gt;= v then(xs, hd :: ys)else(hd :: xs, ys)end
	Would this implementation of the function work? Assuming the max helper function is kept the same. I tried running it on codio but I couldn't find a way to run the tests.

begin match l with | [] -&gt; """" | hd :: tl -&gt; if String.length (max hd) &gt; String.length (longest tl) then max hd else longest tl end	Do we need an anonymous function for the match case hd::tl?	How are we able to use hd as the second argument of fold? Doesn't fold need to take in a list (and hd is an element in the list l)?

"	""If you use IO in your game, you must handle all edge cases and ensure your game does not crash due to bad or poorly formatted input.""

What does this sentence mean? As the programmer, I'm always providing the files that I'm reading in right? So for example, I wouldn't have random comma's in my file if I'm not using commas as a separator. So what does poorly formatted input mean?	 ""and another button, “load” that restores the most recently saved game""

Does this mean it is only necessary to store a single version of the game?
Further, 
""If you use IO in your game, you must handle all edge cases and ensure your game does not crash due to bad or poorly formatted input.""
Since we are formatting the inputs in the case that we are saving to some text file in the program, we know they could never be a bad input or poorly formatted so do we still need to handle these cases?"

	I think there's a problem with Codio - I'm running into errors with the test cases that were already written for the assignment where the error is that ""the expression has type int but an expression was expected of type bool.""

After adding a main method and testing many different print statements within the code, it appears as if there is no infinite loop.  It is just absurdly slow.  As in probably 15 minutes just to loop through one column of the images' pixels slow, and hours for the entirety of the code to finish.  How is this even possible and why is the code running so slow?  What can I do to optimize this? 	I can't see the problem of getting an infinite loop or something?
Can someone help explain? 
My code is also on Codio.	The test passes. Every time I clicked on my GUI it was froze so maybe an infinite loop. However I don't have any places where this could happen. 	my code will not run due to an infinite loop error where would this likely come from
	Ive been looking over my code for a couple days now and there is an error with running the code due to an infinite loop. I am not sure where in any of the classes the error is but my tests for the pixel class all pass while my test for the manipulations mostly fail.	
Why is this an infinite loop?	I am read over the paragraph in the FAQ, but I am unsure of how to solve this problem. If we are not allowed to change a data structure while traversing it in a for-each loop, what do we do? Do we save the object we want and then change it after the for-loop is over?

Why am I getting a ConcurrentModificationException?
This happens when you try to change a data structure while still traversing it in a for-each loop. Look for cases where you are iterating through a collection and adding/removing from the same collection.	So if the recursive call was storing something from a prior method (like 1 + loop (m+1)) then stack space would be exhausted?	


In line 14 of the solution for this question, I think it should say ""loop old_next"" instead of ""loop qn.next"" (not sure though). Because qn.next is the new node that was just added to the queue and calling on that repeatedly would result in an infinite loop as the same node would keep being doubled. 

I am not sure what I am missing logically.	Why does removing an element in a for-each loop result in ConcurrentModificationException but successfully goes through when we use an explicit iterator?	When I test reader inputs ending with a nonword, I get an infinite loop / the tests aren't running. All my other tests are passing. What does this mean about my code?	It's running, but it exits the loop right after the blank line.

this is my file 


and this is the output that the loop prints
	I am getting a NullPointerException when my code has

line = br.readLine();

br is a BufferedReader and line is a String that has been constantly updating through a while loop.
After putting some print statements in to debug my code, I confirmed that the NullPointerException is happening at the very last iteration through the while loop when the next line would be empty.
I am confused on how to get rid of this null pointer exception. I thought my while loop and exceptions would take care of it.

	I'm having trouble looping through BufferReader right now. How would i create a while loop to loop through BufferReader until the reader has no more entries?	Thanks - I'm just a bit confused about the ""storing a"" part - isn't storing a equivalent to setting it to the next character in my sequence, which would be accomplished through the read() function? When I take that part out I get an infinite loop. 	Does this mean I got into something like an infinite loop? 	Do I also need to check if the character is a white space or ""\n"" in the while loop???	I can't figure out which part is causing a time out for the 
testCheckGettysburgSwap() test. What tests can I write to figure this out? How do I know which class is causing it? I don't think it would be the code in spell checker below since I don't think there's any infinite loop. Am I wrong? 
	I changed some of my code, and now when I run my tests, the symbol next to the tests looks like a pink test tube. Does this mean i made an infinite loop, or what?	Is there a way I can prevent the while loop from running again if an exception is thrown?	Is my while loop condition not correct? I check hasNext() and in each loop I call next() to increment the tokenScanner iterator......	It seems to just hang. Why would there be an infinite loop here? That part doesn't make sense at all to me.	How do you break out of a double for loop? 	I'm making Snake and realize I did this backwards in that I did all the back end stuff to model game state first, but I've commented out everything from my run function except for repaint and my program is still an infinite loop (I know because I have to force quit instead of just exiting on close). When I comment out repaint I can exit on close. I'm really struggling to understand why nothing is painting on my screen. I've attached pictures of my snake repaint function and my Game Engine class. When initialized, snakeParts only has one point in it, so I don't think that the draw function is the infinite loop part.

	You can not change the elements in a collection while looping through it with a for loop right? What if you're looping through with a for each loop. Can you change the elements within the loop then?	Why is the result a NoSuchElementException? If it.hasNext() equals false, why would it just not simply exit the while loop?"

"	Why are they pointing to the same record on the heap?	Can := be used with other single field records or does it only work when we have defined the record with ref?	Since a queue in this case is just a record with one field, my idea was to return a record with one mutable field called data whose value is l.  However, I keep getting a syntax error when I build my code and I'm stuck.  Is this the wrong approach?

I basically have { add_change_listener = ""rest of the code""...}.

Thanks!	So after I implemented task 2, it only draws a line when i click and drag, and if I don't drag it, the line would not be drawn (if i only click on 2 points, it doesn't give me a line like before). Is that how it's supposed to work? 	When I click the points button and click my mouse down and start to drag, all the buttons disappear except for the canvas and no points appear. Could you help me understand which step I went wrong on? 	After removing the two click implementation of MouseDown, should you still be able to draw a line by clicking once and clicking again in a different location or will you only be able to draw a line via dragging? That is what is currently happening for me.	For the checkbox is it okay to just be able to click the box part itself or does it need to be able to click the label e.g. ThickLines, or State Light in litghtbulb? 	Are we supposed to be able to see the points when we click the point button?

Before I start implementing my code, i""m wondering if you could confirm my thought process on choosing a data structure? 
Since every client has a unique user ID assigned to him/her, and a username that they can change, the server class should store client information (user ID and username) in a Tree Map structure so that the ID is the key which is unique but users can have same username. In addition, the server will use a map to store the users in each channel, using user ID as keys and the String channel name as values; so that each user can be in multiple channels.
Does this choice make sense?

Thank you!

	When adding users to channels, we need to return two Broadcasts, one letting the user know the names of all the users in the channel, and one letting the users in the channel know the name of the newly joined user.

Is there any way around this?	Never mind, I got it! I wasn't broadcasting the message to the newly joined user as well.	Hi!

I made myself a User class that stores nickname and ID, and a Channel class that stores the channel owner and a list of users.

I'm a little confused about how I interact with this data in ServelModel if I make a treemap of &lt;user, channel&gt; (thereby associating the channels that a user is a part of). 

How would I access the nickname of a certain user? How do I iterate through maps (I checked the java docs and doesn't seem to address this).
example: I want to iterate through my treeMap of &lt;user, channel&gt; and call methods defined in the User class on each user/locate a User with a specific feature	Hey! Before I actually start writing task 2 in hw, I just wanted to check if my plan is reasonable/logical. 

I plan create two additional classes user and channel - I plan to have the channel as a collection of such users, and a server as a collection of such channel. A user has a static final user id and a changable username. A channel has an owner (private instance variable) and a treeset that stores all the users that are in the channel. Similarly, I plan to use a treeset to store all the channels in a server.

And to store all the users in the server - also a treeset. and to keep track of which user has which id, maybe a treemap that maps the user id to the user? 

Sorry this is a bit long! I hope this makes sense. Thank you :) 	thank you! Another question: upon disconnection if user A is in channel 1, 2, 3, 4 and user B is in channel 1, 2 and user A disconnects, should user B be informed twice about the disconnection?

""You will want to construct a broadcast using the disconnected static method. This method takes the nickname of the user who just quit the server, as well as a set of nicknames of users who were in the same channels as the disconnected user.""

Am I supposed to have the set initialized anyways? 	Hello! I can't decide between different options of what collections to use; I'm having a hard time determining what qualifies as overly complex. As one option, I have:
A class for a User, with an ID (int) and nickname (string)A class for channels, with an owner (User), name (string), and list of users (LinkedList)A LinkedList for channels in the server
As another option, I have
A TreeMap with user ID numbers as keys and nicknames as valuesA class for channels, with an owner name (string), owner ID (int), name (string), and a TreeMap of usersA LinkedList for channels in the server
The problem I'm having the most trouble with is when implementing functions with the first option, I have to loop through LinkedLists multiple times for different functions, which I recognize is inefficient. However, through the other option, I couldn't figure out how to return a user ID given a user's nickname.

Is there a better way to organize the data that I'm not seeing?

Thanks!	Would it be considered too inefficient to keep the User class and have a TreeMap of IDs and Users (which would include both their nickname and ids)?	In the changenicknames and deregister user commands, the  broacast object needs to be relayed to all channels that the specific user leaving or changing nickname is in. However, the only functions I see in ServerModel is to get all the channels and get all the users in  a specific channel. Do we have to make another function that returns all the channels a user is associated with to continue with these commands?	Sorry, I made a mistake in calling my helper method something that already exists. 

So the getUsersInChannel method that we're given will return all of the user nicknames for a given channel.

That's not what I'm trying to do here. Here I have a helper method (which I've now renamed to ""getVisibleUsers"") that, when given a userID OR a nickname (not both simultaneously) will return a map of the users in a channel with our given user. For instance if my given user is in 3 channels, I want to return a map of the users in each of those 3 channels, without duplicates (because other uses might be in all of those channels as well and I don't want duplicates so when I broadcast they don't get multiple of the same broadcasts). I also want to exclude my given user from that returned Map. 

What I'm trying to do above with overloading is implement the function one way for an userID argument and a separate way for a nickname argument. But each version will return the same Map.	in part 4, do we have to account for when the user to join/leave doesn't exist? or does that just fall under the user not in channel error?	what should we do if we are passed in the id of a user who was not registered in the server to begin with?

	Using invite as an example, if the user invited doesn't exist AND the channel name does not exist, does it matter which error we return?	if i'm creating an object for each user which is essentially a map, how do I get the key value? I don't see a method for it in the java docs of treemap	If we are given an int userId as an input, can we assume that a user was already added to the collection of users stored in the data structures of ServerModel, and now we just need to add its nickname? Or do we need need to create a new user with the userId input and add it to our ServerModel data structures?  	Does this user already exist? Or do I need to make a new instance of a User?	What should happen if you call deregisterUser on a userId that corresponds to a user who is in the server, but not in any channels? I know the user should be taken out of the server, but should disconnect be called with an empty Collection too?	Should the user be included in the group that is messaged?	I created a User class at the beginning, and, inside the Command class, there's only get methods for the userID and nickname of the user. Essentially, I could just do new User(userID, nickname) for any method that took in a parameter ""User,"" but that would create a new instance of the same user (not what I want).

Is there any way to access the current user that's calling the command inside the Command class?	Who is notified when one changes their nickname? Just the user or everyone in the same channel as the user?	The major problem with the test was that upon changing the nickname if the user was the owner it did not appear to be in the channel, also if user 1 changes the nickname from 'User1' to 'Duke', 'User1' still appears in the java channel.	In order to keep track of a) what users are in a channel and b) what channels a user is in, I created two maps that maps a user to a set of channels and a channel to a set of users. Would there be a data structure or a simpler way to achieve these two things at once? Any hint would be awesome!! Thank you :) 	Gotcha! So an alternative for me was to have a set of users in the Channel class. However, for the disconnect User method, I needed a set of channels that the user was connected to. In this case, should I iterate through all the channels, get the set of users in those channels, and compare to see if the user is in the channel or should I create a field in the User class that stores the channels that it is in? (I assume the latter is more efficient, but I'm not sure if it would fall under the ""duplicating storage"" catagory) 	I have this same failure as @2954 for this test. I don't know why my recipients do not contain the unaffected user. In my update function for Nickname Command, I change the user's nickname and then I make my collection called recipients equal to the list of users for each channel that the user is in. 

Screen_Shot_20181113_at_11.33.36_PM.png	The user who quit cannot be sent any such notification, since they are no longer in contact with the server.

Do we have to manually take out the user who is leaving from the broadcast, or is that done automatically?	Can we assume that the userId passed into the registerUser method in ServerModel is unique (as in no other user has been created with that same Id) or should we check to make sure before registering the new user?

Thanks.	I was wondering if there was a simple way to consolidate all the users that should be receiving a notification from a user changing his/her nickname (particularly if this user is on multiple channels).

Right now, I'm using 2/3 helper methods that traverse through the channels and checks to see if the user is in them, then adds the rest of the people on the channel to the recipient ""set."" This isn't working for me though, any suggestions?	I have a few questions:

1. How can we access a TreeMap of users stored in a Channel Class from the ServerModel file? Is this possible?
2. If we were to have a TreeMap of users, is a single user defined as its own Map with one key-value pair in it or is it just a single key-value pair? If it is the latter, what type is that/how can we define a single user/owner?
3. What are we expected to test? Are we supposed to add tests to test edge cases of parts of the program that you have already provided us with tests for or are we supposed to test parts of the program that are not being tested yet at all?

Thanks!	The ServerError.java file doesn't include an error message for when we are trying to register another user with the same user Id. If we register the user again with the same id, it will now have a different name since the generatenickname() function will increment every time you create a new user. How do we handle this?	I created the private class User which implements Comparable&lt;User&gt; in the same file. I'm a little confused about what goes into the class, though -- is there documentation or notes to help with this outside of the homework instructions?	If you change a user's nickname before they have entered any channels, do you still notify them of the change?	when we're doing deregisterUser, do we have to account for if the user we're trying to remove doesn't exist, and if so, what should the method return? 	Hello y'all;

I apologize for posting code in advance, I've just been a little dizzy looking at it! —

My thought process:
1. user is a User which I remove from the treeMap of users that I have defined at the top of the servermodel.
2. people.remove(username) helps me remove the name of the person who just got removed from the server from the set of names which I broadcast disconnected to.

Do y'all have any idea why I might be getting testDeregisterSendsDisconnectedWhereMember wrong?

	If i am using a TreeSet for my collection, i update it using for each loops, but will I get off for not using all the invariants of a TreeSet?

For example when trying to update my server model, I just use (for User u : userTree) {} and then iterate until I find the correct User and userTree is a TreeSet and update the respective User in the tree. Is that OK?	Who do we notify when we invite the user? Only people in the private chat or all the channels that the target user (invited user) is in?	when i run my client for some reason it seems like there are 2 users even though i only open a single instance of the server so i would expect only one user to be available on the server-any idea how this may be happening. This console shows this:
Response sent to user 0: "":User0 CONNECT""
Response sent to user 1: "":User0 CONNECT""
Request received from user 1: ""NICK nick""
Response sent to user 1: "":User0 NICK nick""

but i don't know how user1 gets there	How do we make more than 1 clients? When i run the client file the only user in the chat is user0 and i don't know how to add more.	I am on task 4, user input (interactive) part.	Are we required to write extra methods in our ServorModel solely for the purpose of testing? For example if I want to write a test that checks if a user has successfully been admitted to a channel by checking the list of channels the user maintains, there is currently no method in ServorModel that gives me this data. I can use the getUsersInChannel method to see whether the user is in the channel but if I want to check the channel list maintained on the user's end, I will need to write another function. Is it recommended that I do that or would it be better for encapsulation if I don't?	I made two classes, User and Channel. Should I submit User.java and User.class (from bin)? or just User.java?	I have written code for Task 2,3 and 4 but they all test due to comparable in my users class. I have tried to figure this out but I can't find why this errror is. This is what I have right now. 
public int compareTo (Object k) {
	
	User x = null; 
	
	if (k instanceof User) {
		 x= (User) k; 
	}
	if (userID==x.getID()) {
		return 0; 
	}
	else if (userID != x.getID()) {
		return -1; 
	}
	
	return 1; 
}
	I'm not sure on how to go about clearing user state in this function. I've removed the nickname from the set of recipients but I'm unsure on what else to do.	Well I was using them in Command for the errors. I thought with java you can perhaps not have the elses. I like them, but it makes the code have way more lines. Here's what the pseudocode looks like:
if (user exists) {
    if {user is in channel) {
        kick out the user
    }
    else {
         User not in channel error
           }
}
else {
    user doesn't exist error
}
 	For checkDocument I've seen other posts saying that the Scanner class should be used to get the user input.

1) How do we use the Scanner class to do that? Do we do sc.next()? Should this be returning an int?

2) Once we've used our Corrector to output a set of corrections for the wrong word, how do we present those words (alphabetically) to the user? There are literally no instructions for how to do this.

I assume that once we present the correction to the user we just use the user input to determine which of those corrections to write out. But if the user chooses the ""different"" option and inputs their own word, do we have to handle that ourselves as well?	Does our game have to be able to be ""resized"" if the user drags the corner of the window to make it larger or smaller? Or is it fine if the game remains the same size (and if the user drags to make it smaller than the game board is simply cut off)?	Should a game of checkers force a user to capture a piece if there is a piece that player can capture? Or can the user opt not to capture a piece even if they can?	How do we user anonymous inner class to use action listeners in our project?	If I want to generate a new game when the user selected ""Yes"" when asked ""Do you want to play again"" in an JOption Pane, how can I go about doing this? I try to create a new board by instantiating it again but that wouldn't give me everything that I need like asking the user for their name, etc. Is there any way to invoke the run method again?	Hi, I'm implementing File I/O for high scores, and my pop up dialogue appears when I run the code, so that before the user closes the window again, the user name will always be his/hers. If there is another user wants to play, he/she will have to close the window, and re-run the code. But after the second run, the recod from the first run disappears in the file. 

Is there anything to do to keep all the records of previous runs? Thanks.	Yup that’s exactly what I mean!If the user does enter their input, it will start a new game. If the user enters incorrect input, the system will show them a pop up error message and prompt them for input again. I’m doing PacMan, and when I have this cancel situation, the ghosts on the screen continue to move but I lose the ability to use PacMan using key controls. 	Hi, I'm trying to find a way to prompt the user for a username if they quit before the game is finished but i'm having a hard time -- any hints?	So its ok to print to the console instead of sending the user a JPane error message?	Hi, I'm doing File I/O on the highest score of minesweeper. Is it ok that I only allow users to input their names after they won (aka they have swept all the mines)? Since I'm thinking about based my ranking solely on the time used if the user has won the game. Or I should be able to allow every user to have their inputs, regardless of win or lose? Thanks!	If the game doesn't ask for the user input, how do we know what to store along with the high score? Should we just randomly assign a name? 	Hi, I was reminded by my friend that this might be a problem:

I used File I/O to display my top 3 scores, but when I let my friend play my game and she thought it is not competitive (my game is Whack A Mole, so there is not win or lose, just within a time limit you try to whack as many moles as possible, so you score can be higher). 

So I decided to make changes to my File I/O methods: if the current user gets the a score that a previous user has already played out, then this score won't be assigned to the current user, it will only be under the name of the first user that played out this score. I think this is a (slightly) better way to make my game competitive, because this can encourage the users to get higher scores. I also explained this in the Instructions and in ReadMe. 

Is this OKay thay I made up my new rules? I'm a little worried."
"	My thickness slider works, so the lines will change thickness when I drag a long the slider, but the rectangle within the slider does not move with my mouse. Does this stem form a problem in my widget code?"
"	My sliders are working properly and change the color of all the shapes. However, after I implemented this widget my color buttons stopped working. Clicking on them does nothing - the color stays at what the slider set. Do you know why this may be?	Do we have to code the color slider and color buttons to work dependently? Meaning should clicking a color button also change the sliders?"
"	Am I correct in my understanding that: An object can be cast to a subclass or super class of its static class type. Any method called by this object must also be defined in the casted class for the compiler to pass. Once the casting has compiled, it is in run time that one checks to see if there is a possible class-cast exception?	Do you always push a ""this"" on the stack when you create a new object and/or do a dynamic method call?	Under part 1 for (i), o.equals(new Object()) is listed as false but under the explanation on page 4 it then says

o.equals(new MyObject())   → true

Which one is correct or is the bottom example something different?	I thought that this function was going to be called in the updateServerModelMethod. If we're calling it in the constructor, what ServerModel object do we call it on?	For both Java and OCaml ASM,

If say you have some object o which is not a primitive type,
let x = o;Object x = o;
if o is is in the heap, then x is on the stack
Then what happens to o when you set x to a different object p? Does o completely disappear from the stack or is it left there with nothing referenced to it?
let x = p;Object x = p;	If object is at the root of any class or implementation, then can we potentially cast object to really anything underneath it in a hierarchy tree?	So does it mean, if we are using it on the string, .equals means structural equality; but if we have:

Object o = new Object();
Object x = o;

then .equals has the same function as ==?	I have another question- If we still use the code:

Object o = new Object();
Object x = o;

Why cannot we say o == new Object(), but we can say o == x? I read through the recitation explanation but still kind of confused :(	Another question- 

Object o = new Object();
Object x = o;
String s = ""yes"";
int i = 1;

the recitation says s.equals(o) can compile can give a ""false"", because all classes inherit from Object, so does it mean I can also write

 i == o;

which can compile and return a false??	I'm having a hard time with the exam problems where you have to convert a Java object to an OCaml object. Any tips for these kinds of questions? Also, are we required to have memorized the syntactic sugar for refs?	If I want to define a new object, where should I write the code for this object? Does it need a new file or can I put it at the bottom of another file, for example, ServerMain?	The only times it is necessary to return a copy of some variable is if the variable is an object that is not a string. Is this correct?	I am creating the game brick breaker. There is a paddle at the bottom of the screen (which I am using square from mushroom of doom) that the ball bounces off of. I am using the hit object method that came from the game object class. It is working fine except for the ends of the paddle (I made the square into a long rectangle), the ball is just moving right through it. I have been trying to figure out why this is happening since the hit object takes the width into account. Is there a specific method/variable that is causing this?	To implement high scores, I created a HighScore Object that stores a String username and int score. I want to override the compareTo method for this object so I can sort it within a collection. I want the new compareTo method to just compare the int score of this object to the int score of another HighScore object. What would be the best way to do this?	Is there a good way to clone an object that I created to provide encapsulation? In this case its a Piece object, that is used with a dynamic subtype, so I can't call a Piece constructor, so I don't necessarily know which subtype an instance of Piece is stored as?	On the instructions it says we can't use game object but if we have added multiple other abstract methods to it is that fine to do?	what is the dynamic type for the object?
and why must the object instance referred by al contain a field for b?

"	Hello! I was wondering if in Ocaml when you use  tl and xs during pattern matching they are like “Ocaml reserved keywords” and we have to use those words to represent the tail of a list as opposed to using words like like tail or tomatoes. 	What function will change the string lists into sets of words? Not sure I understood the quesion properly	What could be the issue if the lightbulb program is only responding to clicks on the words, rather than the whole box.	Here is the beginning of the sequence in which it is adding to my collection of words

words in scanner: []words in scanner: [RTF]words in scanner: [ANSI, RTF]words in scanner: [ANSI, ANSICPG, RTF]words in scanner: [ANSI, ANSICPG, COCOARTF, RTF]words in scanner: [ANSI, ANSICPG, COCOARTF, COCOASUBRTF, RTF]words in scanner: [ANSI, ANSICPG, COCOARTF, COCOASUBRTF, FONTTBL, RTF]words in scanner: [ANSI, ANSICPG, COCOARTF, COCOASUBRTF, F, FONTTBL, RTF]

	If a word appears twice, is this two words or one in terms of the size?	Can we assume that the input file to FileCorrector does not contain any non-words?	Does the FileCorrector have to contain both the misspelled words and corrections, or just the corrections?	Does the case of the words in the dictionary matter? Is it ok to store all of them as lower case, or is it expected that when a file is created with all of their values, this file has the original cases of the words?	Token Scanner will only handle conditions that are strings that alternate between words and non-words right? 
So there won't be input string such as ""&amp;%Contest%%%"" Like this? With two or more consecutive non-word following together?	Should an exception be thrown if the misspelled or correct words are not actually words?	My isWord method has this in the case that the word is not an exact match. I'm using TreeSet to store all my dictionary words but I don't think that's relevant.

//if it's not a match, check for alternate capitalizations
    	for (String currentWord : words)
    	{
    		if (currentWord.compareToIgnoreCase(word) == 0)
    		{
    			return true;
    		}
    	}
    	return false;
With this implementation isWord isn't passing any of my, or the provided tests. For instance testDictionaryContainsSimple fails at Banana.

Why is compareToIgnoreCase not working here?? This seems like it should be really simple but it's not working.	I'm actually soo confused right now. On the off chance the above implementation just isn't the right approach, I changed my Dictionary constructor so when I add a word it's already all lower case. And then in my isWord I can just check whether my words collection contains the lowercase version of the word being passed in.

But that doesn't work either! Please help.	The instructions say one of our test cases for isWord should be 

The dictionary file has words with whitespace around them, and you check if one of those words is in the dictionary.
But the function header in the Dictionary file says 

@param word A String token to check. Assume any leading or trailing whitespace has already been removed.

Which is it?	Should getNumWords take a short time even for really big dictionaries, like Dictionary.txt provided? 

The problem is mine takes forever because as I iterate through the words I add unique entries into a ""seen"" collection and then check new words against that to make sure it's not a duplicate. But this takes forever cause I have to iterate through ""seen"" for every new word? (it's pretty fast for short dictionaries though...)

Is there a better approach that I should be using? For reference I'm using TreeSets to store my both my dictionary word set as well as the ""seen already"" set.	 public FileCorrector(Reader r) throws IOException, FormatException {
    	try {
    		reader = new BufferedReader(r);
        	words = new TreeMap &lt;String, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt; (); 		//key has incorrect words, and value has a set of corrections
        	
    		while (reader.read() != -1) {
    			String temp = (reader.readLine()).trim();
    			if (temp.equals("""")) {}
    			else if (isInvalidLine(temp)) {
    				throw new FormatException(temp);
    			}
    			else {
    				int indexOfComma = temp.indexOf(',');
    				String wrong = (temp.substring(0, indexOfComma).trim()).toLowerCase();
    				String correction = (temp.substring(indexOfComma+1).trim()).toLowerCase();
    				
    				if (words.containsKey(wrong)) {
    					words.get(wrong).add(correction);
    				}
    				else {
    					Set&lt;String&gt; entry = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();
    					entry.add(correction);
    					words.put(wrong, entry);
    				}
    			}
    		}
    	}
    	
    	catch (NullPointerException e) {
    		throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    	}    	
    }
When I printed out the map (words) where all of the incorrect words and their corrections are kept, I realized that the first letter of each of the incorrect words is being cut out. I have no idea why however, because I am pretty sure I am using the substring method properly.

key: himpanze 
value:  chimpanzee


key: igger

(not the small one) 	I decided ArrayList because I could use the get function to get words throughout the list, I tried switching to LinkedList but that still did not fix my error. How can I use a function in TreeSet to get the values at indexes throughout the dictionary?	Hello y'all,

Quick 3-question:
1. how are we supposed to pass in the string with which we want to check against the dictionary.isWord( )?
2. do we create a private field string outside of the constructor? 
3. will we need to map incorrect words to a set of correct words, or just store possible correct words from the dictionary into a set that we end up returning in getCorrections( )?

private TreeSet&lt;String&gt; store = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;(); // the set of corrections
 private String word; // the word we are producing a set of corrections for

    public SwapCorrector(Dictionary dict) {
     this.word = word;	For some reason, my dictionary getNumWords works if I start with a small number of words and add to it up until around 7000 words, and then it maxes out and will only start returning 1105 words, no matter which file. I don't understand why this could be happening, since it works for smaller files that I build up, but once it reaches ""too many"" words, it drops down and stays at 1105.

	can we assume that the reader with the wrong and corrected words will contain only valid words.	When would we ever use our own dictionary to spellcheck against a random given file/document? I thought the dictionary is usually what the Corrector looks to for corrections, I'm confused as to where you'd use the passed-in dictionary in the checkDocument method. 	But what if we’re passed a document with words that aren’t in our dictionary or corrector? 	I'm really confused about how to use the underlying data structure of dictionary in the swap collector constructor in order to be able to access and use the words in the dictionary. I tried casting the dictionary to the data structure, but I got a ClassCastException. Any tips/hints would be very helpful!	Let's say we have a dictionary .txt. file:""wo rd1"""" word2""""word3 """" word4 ""Which ones of these words should be considered as valid words in dictionary?	I'm confused on how we are supposed to manage the token scanner alternating between words and non words.  If there is a comma, how can you group the "","" to be "", "" because mine only sees the comma as a non-word character and then the space as one as well.	When creating the FileCorrector, I'm using a BufferedReader to read in one line at a time from the text file.  However, I'm confused about what to do from there and I don't know how to read individual words to determine what the incorrectly-spelled word is and what the correction is. Any tips on how to do this?	Should we check that when passing in a file to the make function of dictionary it weeds out the words that include non-word characters in them, such as Th!s and Th0se?	I have tested dictionary using all of the given tests as well as written my own, but when I am running my spellchecker it is failing because it is saying that all words are not words (brown, Fox, jumping, etc.) I could see how there could be an edge case in my dictionary code that I wouldn't have tested for, but for it to be telling me that all of the words don't exist seems unlikely. Is there another reason this could be happening? 	In checkDocument(), should we be using a TokenScanner to read all of the words in the document? I'm not sure how else to do it.	Gotcha! So when considering which String input is ""invalid"" for the SpellChecker #1 option, should we say that words not in the dictionary are invalid or just not words according to the TokenScanner are invalid? Confused because highly is not in dictionary.txt	can we assume that only words that are only lowercase or words like Word are the only ones going to be passed into the getCorrections method? ie: no words like wOrd or WORD
	I noticed dictionary.txt does not contain the plural forms of words. Would there be a way to acquire a more extensive text file for my game?	I'm reading in words from a dictionary that are at least three letters in length, but whenever I call isWord on any word it always returns false (for both actual words and non-actual words). Is it because of the way I'm reading through the dictionary? I've posted the code below. I also instantiate the dictionary object in my game class and use the method on the word the user inputs. The file that I'm using is dictionary.txt that was provided to use for the spell checker homework. 

public class Dictionary {	// Set that stores words that are at least three letters in length     Set&lt;String&gt; words = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();     // constructor     public Dictionary(String filename) throws IOException {    	Reader r = new FileReader(filename);    	BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(r);       	String line = br.readLine();     	line.trim();        	while (line != null &amp;&amp; line.length() &gt;= 3) {    		words.add(line.toLowerCase());     		line = br.readLine();     		line.trim();     	}    	    	if (r != null) {             r.close();         }    }        // Function that returns true if the word is in the dictionary set     public boolean isWord(String word) {    	if (word == null) {    		return false;     	}    	System.out.println(words.contains(word));    	return words.contains(word.toLowerCase());     }}    	
	That doesn't fix the problem. It still thinks both actual words and non words are still false when we check to see if it's a word with isWord	Is there any way to change the size of my text in this code (it displays incredibly small and I couldn't find a size method for JOption Panes):

final String INSTRUCTIONS = (""\r\n"" +     			""Players have three minutes (shown by the countdown timer) to find as many words as they can in the grid, according to the following rules:\r\n"" +     			""\r\n"" +     			    			""The letters must be adjoining in a 'chain' (Letter cubes in the chain may be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)\r\n"" +     			""Words must contain at least three letters\r\n"" +     			""No letter cube may be used more than once within a single word \r\n"" +     			""Each word that is guessed correctly receives one point\r\n"" +     			""Already guessed words do not receive additional points, even if they are located elsewhere on the board\r\n"" +     			""\r\n"" +     			""Please OK to begin""    			);    	JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, INSTRUCTIONS, """", JOptionPane.PLAIN_MESSAGE);

"	Yes the head and the separator are strings, but when I try to do the recursion on the case to make it go back through the tail it won't let me. I think my error is syntax on how to write it. I can't find anywhere to figure it out though.	When I submitted, I got a failure for my remove within OLSet not short-circuiting:

let rec remove (x: 'a) (s: 'a set) : 'a set =  begin match s with  | [] -&gt; []  | head::tail -&gt; if x &lt; head || x = head then tail  else head::remove x tail  end

I have since modified my code to:
let rec remove (x: 'a) (s: 'a set) : 'a set =  begin match s with  | [] -&gt; []  | head::tail -&gt; if x &lt;= head then tail  else head::remove x tail  end

Should that take care of the short-circuiting problem? Or is there something I'm missing here...I feel like my code is short circuiting by exiting if the element is less than head	
Thanks! Does the following code still count as short-circuiting?

let rec remove (x: 'a) (s: 'a set) : 'a set =  begin match s with  | [] -&gt; []  | head::tail -&gt; if x = head then tail  else if x &lt; head then head::tail  else head::remove x tail  end	Should we be calling some sort of function on the head and the tail? I stuck on what I need to do after I call the function to add to the queue. 	Do we even need to use peek_head and peek_tail for our testing in deque? Couldn't we just use to_list instead, which contains the head and tail?	Can we not use q.head or q.tail when writing our function?	For the reverse function, do the head and tail of the deque switch?

For example, if the deque before was head = 3, 5, tail = 7, then after reverse would it be head = 7, 5, tail = 3?	To implement reverse, I'm trying to swap the head and the tail and then just change all of the pointers in the middle. However, I'm a little confused about how to swap head and tail. Should I be swapping before anything else happens, or should there be some sort of a storage variable?	Is switching the head and the tail as simple as doing let x = q.head in q.head &lt;- q.tail; q.tail &lt;- x? This doesn't seem to be working. 	for these functions, it says we should delete the element closest to the tail/head respectively... does that mean that if the chosen element I am deleting is the head or tail, it shouldn't be deleted?	what is this function supposed to do?
in the first test case why is remove_head d = 1
if the head is removed shouldn't it be ()?	Is tail-call needed in any other place except to_list function?	In delete in my if then statements, since I'm checking for referential equality, is there a way for me to check if q.head == n.v or n.next? I know I am comparing two different types (that is the error I am getting, but q.head.v or q.tail.v both don't seem to work. Any help with this would be appreciated!!	I can't figure out reverse. I'm not sure when to change the pointers for the head and the tail. I can't change the next of the head to tail at the beginning of the pattern match because that would make loop call a None value. But when I change the next of the head at the end, it still says invalid queue. I've tried tracing through, but I can't seem to figure out what's wrong. 	I am confused as to why the reverse function cannot be executed simply by switching the head and tail markers on the deque. Since the dqnodes are linked on both ends, shouldn't this reverse the order?	Why do we need them to be referentially equal exactly/ is there a way to make them referentially equal while implementing separate functions to find a head and a tail?
I had written my code such that there was a function that returned a head and one that returned a tail and the queue was defined using each. Even if in the singleton case I run the same head function to define both the head and the tail they won't be referentially equal. 	let switcheroo (q: 'a deque) : unit = hd = q.head in q.head &lt;- q.tail; q.tail &lt;- hd

Codio doesn't let me do this, why?	A previous post suggested to pattern match on the options, but there's no option type as input, only an anonymous function and a a' list. I was thinking of pattern matching on the list, applying f to the head and recursively calling on the tail but apply f to the head results in an error because it returns type option. What is a way around this?	I am getting a single failure under deques remove head/tail, and I can't quite identify why. My code for each is very similar, so I can't even identify which function might be causing the error. 	Hi, I got a error message when submitting saying ""first failure: cyclic lists!"" and the failure is in remove head/tail. Does this mean something in remove head/tail does not work so it throws an error when passing in a cyclic list? 

Thanks	So, to be clear, does fold go from the head to the tail of a list or the other way around?	Wouldn't enq relocate the head and tail to point to 2? 	I had a different question about this one why does q.head.next=q.tail fail to type check? 	In this problem, when setting q.tail &lt;- q.head why does changing what the head points to after this not change what the tail points to?	q.head.next = q.tail
According to the 2016 spring exam, this does not type check. Why is this the case? Q.tail refers to Some of a node and same as q.head.next.	So if head and tail both point to the same thing, does that mean the queue is invariant?

I thought these were the conditions that satisfied queue invariant:
1) both head &amp; tail are None
or 2) Head = some n1
        Tail = some n2
         n2 is reachable by n1.next, n2.next is None	I am a bit confused as to why the example proposal says remove from the head of a linked list for the undo function. I guess it depends on the implementation, but wouldn't it also make sense to remove from the tail (as it is the last operation that is done?) 	I'm confused about where ArrayList and LinkedList are placed in the answer key - Shouldn't the LinkedList be the best choice if entries are often added/removed from head/tail, since it has head and tail pointers and doesn't have to resize each time?

I'm not really sure why I'm getting the errors I'm currently getting for my implementation of the list_layout.

I find myself unable to take advantage of make_control because whenever I want to use it I find myself needing to be able to reference the listeners func list in the widget handle in order to be able to execute the listeners on a value-changing event.

For example, my radio button and checkbox implementations both work fine, but I find myself calling the listener functions inside of the widget handles. Is that the most ""proper"" way to implement these widgets. Because it seems haphazard that I'm basically copy and pasting make_widget just so the listeners list is in scope.	I am working on checkbox but I am really confused on how to structure the function/what syntax to use, I have complete make controller and use it in the function but I cant seem to understand where and how the record fields of the widget itself come into play.

	I have everything working for checkbox except the fact that clicking the box doesn't repaint the box as black (it is originally painted as white to signify being unchecked).

Or, is a checkbox completely separate from a button? (but has some of the same functionality). 	
Just wondering, if I were to ever call vpair on 2 widgets, would the g above ever be specified? Basically how does the function use the widget's gctx if I never specify it?	Shouldn't that not matter? Label doesn't change when the checkbox is clicked right?	I'm changing this to private because it is about my specific implementation. So, I figured out that the tests aren't passing because widgetTest.ml uses the click55 event, which is a MouseDown event that is located at (5,5). However, my implementation of checkbox is an hlist of a label, a space, and a custom widget that is essentially a rectangle with either an x drawn on it or not depending on the state of the value controller. I put the actual changing of the value controller in the handle function of the custom widget, so the toggling of the checkbox only happens when the user actually clicks on the actual box (not the label or the spacer). So, the tests don't pass because (5,5) is a point that falls within the label, so nothing triggers. Isn't this desired behavior?	I keep getting this error in my handle part of my widget in checkbox for all the different event_types.

Not sure what's wrong. 	How do we know how big to make the part of the checkbox that has an X in it when clicked? I'm assuming you have to do an hpair on 2 widgets, one that has an X when clicked and a label widget.	Should checkbox always draw its label and an X? Or should checkbox be more generic? I'm thinking of lightbulb and if I remember correctly there was no rectangle with an X, the click was simply on the label and then the state changed to yellow or black. If checkbox is more generic, then what do we pass into checkbox and how does this change the repaint and handle functions within the Widget.checkbox?	For the checkbox, am I understanding correctly that the label has to be with the checkbox, which means we have to use hpair? I'm confused to how to pair it together since label returns a widget*label_controller but then hpair pairs widget and widget? 	widget	So is it okay if I define the size of checkbox widget to only include the actual checkbox and the label?	At what position should the checkbox be in this canvas? When I'm calling draw_rect and draw_string in repaint, I'm not sure what points to input because if it is a generic widget, then the location should be generic too, or am I understanding this wrong?	I am a little bit confused with the concept of radio button group widget.

Are radio buttons basically the same of group of checkboxes except that it has the property that once we check one of them then the others should automatically be unchecked?

So is radio button kind of like a larger widget containing several small widget in it? But if it is the case, how are we suppose to get and manipulate the state of any one small widget?	I am super confused about how to make my newly defined checkbox in paint.ml listen to mouseclicks on the widget it contains. I would assume that, given my checkbox (checkbox_label, state), I would call checkbox_label.handle (g) (e), but I'm confused about where I should be getting my graphics context and event.

I've also thought about implementing this listening using state.add_change_listener, but I also am not sure what I would input into this function. 	I added a change listener value to the value_controller type signature in both widget.ml and widget.mli to store all of the change_listeners in, but when I define my add_change_listener function I get the error ""unbound value change_listener""?	I'm having trouble with keeping the slider widget filled in once I have slid it a certain amount. When I'm sliding it, the widget gets filled in with a black rectangle, but as soon as I let go, it becomes white again. I have this functionality in my handle function for the widget right now, and I'm not sure if that's the best place to put it?	what is the significance of (5,5)? Is that were we should put our checkbox?	Since we have to create a widget in the process of creating a checkbox, we have to define the functions for repaint, handle, and size.  Should we be calling repaint in handle since that will affect how to draw the checkbox?  I am calling repaint on the widget (in the definition for handle) and it is giving me an error and saying that the name of the widget is an unbound value.  How should I fix that?	The checkbox on my lightbulb is very tiny even though the area which triggers a change is much larger.  Also, the text is in a weird location and I can't figure out how to move it.  How do I make the checkbox bigger and move the text?	In my handle function of checkbox, when I run widgetTest, it says that the tests with odd numbers of clicks aren't passing, which I think means that my bool value for whether or not the box is checked is never changing. But I have written my function to change the value if there is a mouseDown event on the widget, so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Is there something I'm not accounting for when writing this function?	I finished 6 and was wondering what is the appropriate amount of comments I should make throughout widget, paint and gctx? What is expected and what is overkill? Thanks!	I have gotten to the point in task 5 where I have a functioning ""thick lines"" button that allows me to toggle back and forth between thick and thin lines, however I am having trouble understanding how to visually implement the checkbox widget such that we can tell whether thick lines is toggled on and off. I know that we want to thick lines button to have an indicator and label widget hpair but I am having difficulty understanding why I can't just draw the indicator within the button? am I misunderstanding the difference between a button and checkbox?	I was wondering what the difference between using the let declaration ( tuple here ) = [function] with checkbox and button were. Specifically, I am wondering why the variables i am specifying in the tuple for my checkbox are showing a warning as not being used while a similar implementation in the let declaration for the button does not show this error.	I am working on making a slider widget (at the very bottom of my widget.ml) and my repaint and handle functions are underlined with errors that don't make sense to me. For repaint it is saying that I'm making something bool but I'm not, and I'm also getting an error for handle. I've reloaded and they're still there, so I figure I must be doing something wrong, but I can't figure that out. I'm hoping someone might be able to look at my slider widget and point me in the right direction.	i am getting the following error when i try to compile 

File ""paint.ml"", line 277, characters 22-28:

       It is applied to too many arguments; maybe you forgot a `;'.

can you point me to what I am doing wrong?	Do we need to set the state of the checkbox to an actual true or false value, or to just whatever is passed in?, e.g. something like:

 (*Initial state of checkbox*)  let checkbox_state = make_control init in
	Does the visual indicator of a checkbox/radio button being selected need to be implemented in the widget itself or can it be implemented as needed in the paint class? 	I'm confused how to do this without defining a widget within a widget. As in, if we want to implement an X or a square filled in (which to my understanding would be another widget). How are we supposed to paint it within the other widget's repaint field?	My thickness check box works perfectly, however for some reason the actual box that gets filled in keeps appearing above my label as shown in the screenshot. I have been trying to debug for sometime now but I can not figure out why it is still going above it as in my checkbox widget it is coming out as an hpair, but is not being drawn as an hpair for some reason. I tried looking on piazza for similar questions but my searches did not come up with any other posts so sorry if i missed one by accident. Thanks!

	I tried using the position as local to my widget, but it still doesn't work. I think it's because of the value from the MouseDrag and am not sure. 	Instead of putting a canvas (like lightbulb) to display if the thickness changed or not, I decided to complete a more difficult task by changing the text of the checkbox label itself to show if it is on thick mode or not. I did this simply as an exercise to test myself and my understanding of the paint program. See images below for specifics. Essentially, my question is will I get graded down for implementing checkbox this way? I will remove my code and implement the checkbox with a canvas if desired.Thanks!

	I'm having a little trouble figuring out how to implement the size part for slider widget. Right now it is being implemented as a rectangle that is then filled in based on mouse position. Do we need to use Gctx.text_size label.contents somehow to get the size of this widget? My current implementation does not require a label per say.	In that case:

widget {repaint; handle; size}
That is, the widget needs a way to repaint itself (which will vary depending on whether it is on or off) and a way to handle these events (being clicked, and the click changing the state of on or off). 

However it is in gctx that we specify how to draw the widgets and in paint that we handle the events. The button and canvas widgets don't really deal with either aspects (they return a widget*label_controller*notifier_controller and widget * notifier_controller respectively), and therefore paint and gctx deal with the drawing/handling of the widget. Since checkbox takes in a string, we can add a label to it. But it doesn't have the functionality to draw itself, nor does it return a notifier_controller for the event handling. So how can we make the checkbox widget draw itself and handle an event?

In addition to that, label doesn't take in a widget. So when we call on label with the string given, we get a new widget. How can we then change the values of repaint/handle of that widget? Likewise, we get a label_controller and a notifier_controller, but we don't return either. So what can we do with these values?

(also thank you for the response, it was helpful)	Can someone help with the general idea of how to handle mouseclicks for the checkbox? I know that it would involve a change_listener for the value_controller associated with the widget, but I'm unclear on how exactly the mouseclick event listener would be involved or how to respond to mouseclicks if the event listener isn't necessary.	Through what mechanism does a widget know an event is happening unto itself? i.e. how does the button widget know a mouseclick event happens on the button, and not some other location on the screen?	my checkbox on paint.ml has two components: the label and the box that displays the x when the box is checked. The box is checked when mouse is clicked on the label part and not on the box that displays the x because i used the current color logic and the box is just an indicator not a part of the checkbox. Would you consider that as an design preference or should i change that to work when user clicks on the box as well. Currently in order for checkbox to work the user should click on the label ""thickness""	I made the on-screen component of the thick lines widget but the text of ""Thick Lines"" doesn't go inside the button even though I'm using hpair to do so. The actual button works fine but the text is basically in the middle of nowhere and I'm not sure how to fix this issue.

	I made a label which proved that with a sized 254 widget, the range goes from 0 to 255. However, I am still confused how that is possible with a size 254 widget. 	After reading through other posts, I am still confused as to how to check whether or not the checkbox has been clicked.  You cannot add an event listener since it is not a button.	What is the handle function in checkbox suppose to do?	I'm using the border method to create my checkbox () widget in paint in widget.ml, but I'm seeing errors in my attempt to return its size. It claims size is an unbound module. and is expecting pattern matching when I never wrote a begin match case. Why would this be happening?	What I proposed was to call label on the string, and return its associated widget.e.g. 

(widget, _) = label s in

What you're saying is to call draw_rect on that widget? I know we could use widget.size to find its dimensions, but how would we extract the necessary position from that?	Should the X of the checkbox be inside widget or paint? I think it should be inside paint, since ""lightbulb"" uses the checkbox but uses the yellow/back to show if the checkbox was selected or not. Also, the Homework website does not mention anything about where X should go.
	I defined the checkbox so that it toggles when the user presses on the text instead of the box itself - (I have a 15x15 square to the left of the label that responds to the click just like the lightbulb). So the paint application works, but the widget test fails since it clicks (5,5), which is unclickable in my implementation. Is this fine, or should I change it so that the actual box is clickable?	Hello, I've been stuck trying to design my generic radio boxes function for a while. My approach was to make a widget for each button and have the value controller deal only with whichever button is selected. I want to make a helper function that would link all the buttons into a single widget, but i've been hitting roadblocks... any advice for structure? 	For the Jeopardy question: ""Name two differences between value controllers and notifier controllers""   the answer is: 


A notifier controller’s listener reacts to all events and updates the widget’s private state; a value controller’s listener reacts to changes in the widget’s private state.

Value controllers also have functions to set and get the widget’s private state.


Is it possible for someone to elaborate on the difference listed in number 1?

Hello!

I implemented my checkbox, and it passed all the tests/lightbulb so now I'm on the part of making it toggle.

In what part of the program do we pass in the g and actually draw the thing? I was confused because for instance, when we do hpair, how does it know the initial graphics context to be in?

And my second question is: would there be a more efficient way to do the toggle? Or in fact, I don't even think what I am doing now is correct as I don't think I am constantly checking the value of the boolean controller. Or am I because the event loop is running? Sorry for the confusing questions.

Hello! I've been struggling with the checkbox and had some questions. I chose the method of making a separate widget for the box and adding a notifier to the hpaired box + label so that wherever you click within the widget, it registers the event and changes the value in the boolean controller. I chose to implement the actual crossing by adding a change_listener to the boolean controller. 

The feedback I got from a TA was, however, that ""You may also want to consider the differences between change_listeners and event_listeners.  Neither is better or worse, but it may simplify your code to choose one approach to registering events."" I do see a way I can just use event_listeners, but I don't see how I can approach the entire problem using just change_listeners as I don't see a way to register a click for the entire widget other than event_listeners. Could I get some help with that?

Any suggestions as to why my slider might not be updating the line drawing method?	Hi,

I know I need to work on the add_event_listener part, but I didn't quite get the logic for different mouse events. Should I update the value when dragged? If so, what's the difference between drag and mouseUp? Thank you very much!	I am really struggling with this function, more specifically I am having trouble understanding the step by step process I need to follow in order to implement it. I know that we need to keep track of whether the box has been checked, but does that depend on the state that was passed in? I don't know what it means if ""false"" was passed in versus ""true"", making it difficult for me to know how to set its state in the function. I wrote pseudocode for the widget but I'm not sure what to do with size, nor am I sure about repaint. Do we actually need to draw the checkbox in this function?

  {   (*repaint               : Gctx.gctx -&gt; unit*)      (*If the state of the checkbox has been checked,    *then paint checkbox according to graphics context*)     (*handle:                : Gctx.gctx -&gt; Gctx.event -&gt; unit*)    (*If there is a mouse click event detected within the box, then change   *state of checkbox to ""checked""*)
  (*size                     : unit -&gt; Gctx.dimension*)    (*Don't know what to do here*)  }

After reading the description for this problem and some of the posts, I think my questions make it clear that I understand very little about this function and any help to get me meaningfully started is appreciated

Hello! So for my slider widget, I patternmatched for mouesdown, mousedrag, and mouse up but honestly didn't feel like they should do things differently, so just did what I did above (and it does work!) However, in this case, would I get points off for style? Or more fundamentally, should I do things diffrently for when I drag it, mousedown, and mouse up? 	type slide_controller = {mutable percentage : float; mutable maxi : int}

let make_slide_control (v: int) : slide_controller = 
  {percentage = 1.0 ; maxi = v }

let slider (x: int) (mx: int) : widget * slide_controller =
  let slid = { percentage = (float_of_int (x) /. float_of_int (mx)) ; 
    maxi = mx} in
  let w = {
    repaint = (fun (g: Gctx.gctx) -&gt;

I am attempting to implement the slider widget as shown above. I am getting multiple syntax errors and I am not completely sure that this implementation will work at all. Does this implementation seem logical? And how can I properly access g.x, g.y, event_pos, and mouseDrag?	How does Gctx.text_size work? Does it only return the size of the string when rendered?

Applied to a hypothetical widget containing a string display and a box, would we then need to define this widget's ""size"" field as(fst (Gctx.text_size str) +  x size of box, max (x size of box, snd(Gctx.text_size str)))?	      handle =  (fun (g: Gctx.gctx) (evnt: Gctx.event) -&gt;
         begin match evnt with
          | (Gctx.MouseDrag, _) -&gt; 
            let (x1, y1) = Gctx.event_pos evnt g in
            rcntr.change_value &lt;- x1
          | _ -&gt; ()
          end);
change_value expects a type ('a -&gt; unit). But I don't know how to change the line of code:
rcntr.change_value &lt;- x1
in order for it to have type 'a -&gt; unit ('a in this case is int)

Thanks	So I trying to implement the checkbox widget inside checkbox. This is the code I wrote for

handle = (fun g e -&gt; 	let some_action (): unit = vc.change_value(not (vc.get_value ())) in	if Gctx.event_type e = Gctx.MouseDown then some_action () else ()		
where vc is value controller,

The tests are not passing and I received the ""Graphics.Graphic_failure(""graphic screen not opened"")"" error. The FAQrecommendss that we don't call anything from the graphics module while on the widget module. I'm unsure how to proceed. I have tried alternate implementation like this but had similar results.

"	Hi y'all

So this was kind of hard b/c but I understand the answer but then going back to the question I realized I didn't even know what a closure was!
What is a closure? Is it the entire portion from the ""{"" before withdraw all the way to the last ""}"" in the code, is it the statement ""let balance = { contents = initial_deposit } in"" or is it an ""overarching concept"" that guides the design of this code? Thank you!

°°°°°°°°° ANSWER TO JEOPARDY OCAML 50 PTS °°°°°°°°°
How would you implement this?
   Hint: Use a closure! 

let make_account (initial_deposit : int) : account =
  let balance = { contents = initial_deposit } in
  { withdraw = (fun amt -&gt;
     if amt &gt; balance.contents 
      then (let b' = balance.contents in

"	If we didn't call those methods, would it be fine?"
"	The input file has some lines with mixed case (e.g. word,CoRRecTioN or WORD,correction) and you ask for that word's corrections.We ask for a fully uppercase word that has corrections. What case should the results have?We ask for that same word, but now lowercase, that has corrections. What case should the results have?

I am confused on what should be expected of these three cases.

For the first, if its ""word, CoRRecTioN"", should getCorrection(""word"") return ""CoRRecTioN"" or ""correction""? For ""WORD, correction"", should it be able to work even if we do getCorrection(""word"")? 

For the second one, if it is ""word, correction"" and we do getCorrection(""WORD""), should it return ""CORRECTION"" or ""correction""? 
Are we prioritizing the words in the input files or the word that we use in getCorrection?	What about for multiple words in the input file? For instance, if it was ""word, correction input"": would getCorrection(""Word"") return Correction Input or Correction input?	If I'm understanding matchCase properly, word,CoRRecTioN or WORD,correction should return {correction, Correction} right?	If my file has this :-
word,CoRRecTioN WORD,correction

If I want getCorrection(""word""), Is the output set {CoRRecTioN} or {correction} ??
and I want getCorrection(""Word""), Is the output set {CoRRecTioN} or {Correction} ??	I'm confused what the test case for when a word has Multiple Corrections should return. Because for each misspelled word isn't there only one correct word that should be suggested? For example in the misspellings.txt file, if the user entered the word ""accomodates"" the only correction would be ""accommodates"". 	why does correctWords.add(correction) give an error?	For example, for FileCorrector, if I ask for the corrections for ""Afterall"", should I get a correction like ""After all"" or ""After All""?
Does the capitalization of the first (and only) mispelled word determine whether both the words in the correction are capitalized?

Asking this because my case for getting the correction for ""Capetown"" returns ""Cape town"" (instead of ""Cape Town"") and I'm not sure if this is desired behavior.	Should word,correction and word,CORRECTION return a set with one of the corrections or both when getCorrections for word is called? if it is just one, which case should it return?"
"	Hi! The HW1 says that ""you should _not_ use functions built into OCaml, especially the ones in the List module, except where they are explicitly allowed in the comments."".The pipe operator (|&gt;) is a function built into OCaml. However, it makes the code more readable. For example, let's suppose I have the following functions:
let add (a: int) (b: int) : int = a + b
let multiply (a: int) (b: int) : int = a * b

Then:
multiply 8 (multiply 6 (add 5 8))
Using the pipe function, I have:

which is more readable."

	Apparently there is no option to delete a question so :( changed it to private and changed the content.. sorry! 	Changed question
"	How would I return an empty collection?	Say we have a class and a collection that stores all instances of the class.

It is preferred that we create a separate class for the collection rather than having a static collection included in original class?

Also, is there a protocol we should follow for creating classes in eclipse?  I right clicked the src folder and ""new"" -&gt; ""class""
Then the window below came up and I put in a name, loaded an interface, and chose default package, which Eclipse said was ""discouraged"".  Should I do any of this differently?

	i am using treemap as my collection. do i need to implement comparable and override equals in the servermodel constructor??	does that mean I can't modify a collection while iterating through it? because how else can I remove something from a collection?	I chose to store the userId's and associated nicknames as a map of ints and strings. However, I don't understand how this is a subtype of the collection class or how to return all of the userId's as a collection of strings	ahhhhh, thank you Nick. I was operating under the false assumption that we could only use a single collection in ServerModel so I see a much more efficient way to do this now. 

For getRegisteredUsers, what's the best way to essentially return a keySet() of a treeMap &lt;Nickname, User&gt; so that it DOESN'T violate the instructions: ""changes to the returned collection should not affect the server state?"" (Because with keySet(), as per the API, ""changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa"")	So I just used my first submission, and I failed all of the model state encapsulation tests. I just wanted to ask some questions about what constitutes encapsulation.

I know that all fields should be private and that methods within a class can modify fields. My ServerModel class and its subclasses definitely do this.

I know that my function calls in the Command class's updateServerModel methods should be limited, and that most functionality should be in the ServerModel class.

I did realize while I was debugging my code that sometimes, when I declared a new Collection, modifications to that collection would modify whatever they were pointing to on the heap (which included the global state of the model instance). I think I fixed this by declaring these Collections as empty, and then adding all the contents to this collection rather than adding a pointer.

Is there anything else that I'm missing? I'm going to continue testing the behavior of my functions but I think I caught most of the weird Collections stuff that was causing my bugs.	When I try to run the JUnit tests, I keep getting a compile error that says that my package ""collection name"" does not exist. I get this error on the line that I try to use an Iterator on the keyset of this collection (which is a Tree Map). How could I fix this error?	If I have a User class and within serverModel I am creating a collection of Users, how can I convert that collection to a collection of strings? If I have a field in the User constructor that represents the nickname (string), should I be writing getter methods within the User class to return the nickname and then use those methods within serverModel?	I have to convertToNickSet method which converts an Integer collection to a String collection. But in this method I would need to use the static get method to see what nickname a userId is mapped to. But all get methods are declared non-static. So I'm thinking maybe I should change my mapIdNick to be a non-static variable in ServerModel?	Hi, 
the getUsersInChannel is in the same class. Is there a reason I can't use it in this method? 
The get users inchannel returns a collection of strings.
	for a collection, the remove method returns a boolean, but can we write a method like this 
public void remove (T t, Collection&lt;T&gt; coll) {	coll.remove(t);}
or does the return type need to be boolean?	What's the difference between an empty collection and a null collection? I am trying to return a collection that is sometimes empty in one of my methods in ServerMode, but I keep getting a null pointer exception.	If the returned values is modified, will that change the values in the users collection as well? I'm not sure how this is stored in the heap.

	Is it okay if I make the collection directly in updateServerModel?	Maybe I'm doing this wrong, but how do we initialize a new server model? Does it depend on the type of collection we choose?	Does it maybe have something to do with how Broadcast.names is handling my recipients collection?
	getUsersInChannel returns a collection of strings..however in order to actually use it it must be of type set because objects cant be of type collection...so are we allowed to use casting? 	ArrayList is a type of Collection, right? 	In the example tic tac toe game proposal, the 2d array and collections are considered to not be the same state because undo is implemented using a collection that keeps track of individual moves and not the whole board. 

In my game of connect 4, I'm also implementing undo, but instead of individual moves my collection saves old states of the entire board as int[][] instead of the coordinates of the last individual move. Would my implementation be considered modeling the same state or it is different enough because the collection remembers the orders of the states and not just the current board? Is it necessary to change my collection so it holds moves instead of 2d arrays?	My collection concept depends on this iterator to work properly.... Plz help----"

"	When a user creates a channel, does the channel take on the name of the owner's nickname or is it a unique name?"

l.hasNext(); 
l.hasNext(); 

Does the first hasNext() refer to the 1 and does the second hasNext() refer to the 2? or would they both still refer to the 1 since next() hasn't moved the pointer?

Do not understand Practice Midterm Solution

On the 2016 Spring Midterm, there are two questions on the true and false that do not make sense to me 
 

In Java, if s and t are variables of type String such that s == t, then s.equals(t) is guaranteed to return true.(F)
 
this makes sense because just because they have the same referential value does not mean they are the same object, but for the second question: 
 

In Java, if s and t are variables of type String such that s.equals(t), then s == t is guaranteed to return true.(F)
 
Doesn't make sense following similar logic to the first question. Could you help me understand this?


	In Java, if s and t are variables of type String such that s == t, then s.equals(t) is guaranteed to return true.

Why is it that if they are pointing to the same object on the heap the values may not be equal?	In Java, if s and t are variables of type String such that s == t, then s.equals(t)
is guaranteed to return true. (Answer Key says False)

If s == t returns true, i.e. s and t are referentially equal, why isn't s.equals(t), i.e, structural equality, guaranteed to return true? How can s and t be structurally different if they refer to the same memory location on the heap?	





In Java, if s and t are variables of type String such that s == t, then s.equals(t) is guaranteed to return true. 


== is structural and .equals is referential equality right?

	Hello! I am a little confused about initializing SeverModel; I thought it would parallel how the Point example was done in class, but doing it like this: 
public ServerModel(Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; u, Set&lt;Channel&gt; c) {
        // TODO: Initialize your state here
        this.allusers = u;
        this.allchannels = c;
    }
gives me errors in other files that are supposed to remain unmodified that use:
ServerModel model = new ServerModel();
Should I modify them, or am I misunderstanding what to do?

Thanks!	I am passing all the tests in ConnectionNicknamesTest except for the following one, which I am failing. I can not find the bug. I do not see anything wrong with my getUserID() function below.

}
	Why is it telling me to use object instead of set&lt;integer&gt;? I don't understand. Am I not returning a set&lt;integer&gt;?
	I am trying to call EntrySet() on a map because I want to iterate through my map and add the values to a collection so I'm not breaking encapsulation.

I understand that EntrySet() should return Set&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt;, but when I'm iterating through this set, I don't know how to describe the type of each element. 

For example, a for each loop should look like
(Type t : myMap.EntrySet()) {
}

But I don't know what the Type of t should be. I have tried Map.Entry&lt;k,v&gt; (with k and v being the types I specified in myMap). The java docs for this method are not super helpful about this detail.
	public Collection&lt;String&gt; getChannels() {		Collection&lt;String&gt; copyChannelMap = channelMap.keySet()		return copyChannelMap;	}
Does something like this preserve encapsulation?	public Collection&lt;Integer&gt; getJoinedUsers() {		Set&lt;Integer&gt; userIds = new TreeSet&lt;Integer&gt;();		Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; i = joinedUsers.iterator();		while (i.hasNext()) {			userIds.add((Integer) i.next());		}		System.out.println(""userIds :"" + userIds);		return userIds;	}
Does this? Just trying to make sure. Would I have to write getChannels like getJoinedUsers()?	Hello! 

I currently have a class that represents Users/Clients that has the fields ID and username. So far, I have this: 

public final class ServerModel implements ServerModelApi {
    private Set&lt;User&gt; registeredUsers; 
    private Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; nicknameIDMatch; 
  
    /**
     * Constructs a {@code ServerModel} and initializes any collections needed for modeling the
     * server state.
     */
    public ServerModel() {
        registeredUsers = new TreeSet&lt;User&gt;(); 
        nicknameIDMatch = new TreeMap&lt;Integer, String&gt;();
    }
To begin with, is that a redundant way of initializing the field in the constructor? Couldn't really figure out what to do inside there. 

My second question was: I am trying to implement get ID and get nickname. First, I would need to fill the treemap with the correct values by iterating through the registeredUsers set. However, I am not quite sure as to where to do this. Should I do it every time I call the get method? (but wouldn't this be inefficient?). Not sure if I would do it in the constructor, as the nickname will change and the treemap needs to update accordingly. Where would I initialize my value of the Treemap?

Hello! I'm using a helper function to constantly add to a Set of strings from a set of integers (i have a map that goes from a userID (key, integer) to a nickname (value, String). My question here is: even if I made the helper function void and just called the helper in the main function instead of updating usersToNotify, would I be able to reach the same result?? I wasn't quite sure about the ASM for this code and thought it might make a copy somewhere so just decided to be safe. Am wondering I could just make it void! (Or in fact, since usersToNotify was declared before the for each loop and has a big scope, would it just keep updating?) 

Also bonus question: I understand that a set adds an element if it is not already present. IF you try to add something that is already there, does it just not do anything or does it throw an exception? 	I tried doing
private Set&lt;String&gt; usersInChannelList = Collections.emptySet(); but for some reason it throws another error. Am I going about this incorrectly? Thanks so much	I have a weird syntax error after the second -&gt; in this chunk of code, and it says there should be a { but I don't see why.
I'm also wondering if my code is too inefficient. I store User objects in a Channel with TreeSet, then Channel object inside a ServerModel with another TreeSet. Is this okay?

    public String getNickname(int userId) {
    	TreeSet&lt;User&gt; serverUsers = new TreeSet&lt;User&gt;();
        channels.forEach(c -&gt; serverUsers.addAll(c.getChannelUsers()));
        serverUsers.forEach(u -&gt; if (u.getId().equals(userId)) {
        	return u.getId();
        });
        return -1;
    }
	When I don't include the ""extends TreeSet&lt;User&gt;"", it tells me that I can't iterate over it because it's not an instance of java.lang.Iterable.

I have implemented equals and compareTo and hashCode.  Below are the opening lines of the class without extending treeset.

public class ClientSet{

 private Set&lt;Client&gt; clientSet = new TreeSet&lt;Client&gt;();	When I try to use AssertEquals (to test registered users) with an expected Collection&lt;String&gt;, and my call to model.getRegisteredUsers(), I get the following message:

java.lang.AssertionError: expected: java.util.TreeSet&lt;[User0, User1, User2]&gt; but was: java.util.TreeMap$Values&lt;[User0, User1, User2]&gt;

Why is this occurring if my method getRegisteredUser returns type Collection&lt;String&gt;?
	It says I have a null pointer exception for NicknameSet.add(getNickname(next));
I use a set to store all the channels and with in each channel there is a set contains all users' id in the channel.

Hello! I had a general question about encapsulation. For private fields, I understand that it's good style to include getter methods (even if you don't really need them. Is this correct?) In this case, I was wondering if I was breaking encapsulation by returning currentChannels or currentIdNickname. How would I know if I was returning the value or if I was returning a reference? (Like the thread about encapsulation with collections) 	reader = new BufferedReader(r);
        map = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;();
        String s = reader.readLine();
        while (s != null) {
            int i = s.indexOf("","");
            String wrong = s.substring(0, i-1).trim();
            String correction = s.substring(i+1).trim();
            
            if (map.containsKey(wrong)) {
                map.get(wrong).add(correction);
            }
            else {
                Set&lt;String&gt; set = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;();
                set.add(correction);
                map.put(wrong, set);
            }
            s = reader.readLine();
        }
This is what I have right now, but it doesn't seem to be looping through and adding stuff.	Hi, I received a comparison failure for fourth assertion of the testGetNextTokenWord() test. The token expected should be a space and a line break; however, my actual token returned is comprised of a space and an empty string?

Quick summary:
""file"" is a TreeMap &lt;String, TreeSet&lt;String&gt;&gt;( );
String is the misspelled word
TreeSet&lt;String&gt; is a set of correct words that can ""replace"" the misspelled word.

Question:
1. Currently, I don't think the statement condition (b.read( ) != -1) in my while statement is good enough. Is there anything that I could improve on/consider in this conditional?
2. When I read in the line using a buffered reader ""b,"" I take in the whole line, take in the index and substring the line according to what comes before the comma and what comes after the comma. Is this good enough, or are there other things I should consider?
3. I'm worried my choice in data structure is too complicated... what are some specific things I could consider to make it so that I can use something easier than a TreeMap&lt;String, TreeSet&lt;String&gt;&gt;?
4. When I try to ""put"" the correct word into the TreeSet as the ""value"" of the &lt;k, v&gt; TreeMap ""file,"" should I make the TreeSet into a private field at the top of my code, or should I instantiate the TreeSet in my while loop? This is already feeling too complicated... :'(
5. ""words.add"" returns a boolean but I need it to return a TreeSet... I am also stuck on this as well.

Warmly,

	So I am a bit confused on the constructor for Dictionary. I want to use a TreeSet so i do not have to worry about duplicates, but I only want to add words from the TokenScanner that are words so I was hoping to use the isWord function from TokenScanner to check every string coming from TokenScanner before adding it to the TreeSet. However, isWord is a static function (obviously for a reason), and I am just very stuck on what I should be altering in order to access this static function. Please let me know if I am just misunderstanding the constructor entirely. Thank you! Also, I think I am a little confused on the next function, will that always move on to the next token every time it is called? So i can not call it twice there?
&lt;b&gt;public&lt;/b&gt; Dictionary(TokenScanner ts) {
  &lt;b&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; (ts == &lt;b&gt;null&lt;/b&gt;) {
   &lt;b&gt;throw&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;new&lt;/b&gt; IllegalArgumentException();
  }

  d = &lt;b&gt;new&lt;/b&gt; TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();

  // want to check that the next word in the token scanner is a word, else skip

  &lt;b&gt;while&lt;/b&gt; (ts.hasNext()) {
   &lt;b&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; (ts.isWord(ts.next()) {
    d.add(ts.next());
   }
  }
    }	Hi, I keep getting a null pointer exception, but I cannot think of where it could be?
 public void checkDocument(Reader in, InputStream input, Writer out) throws IOException {    	 Scanner sc = new Scanner(input);        TokenScanner ts = new TokenScanner(in);                        while(ts.hasNext()){        String next = ts.next();        if(!TokenScanner.isWord(next) || dict.isWord(next)){        	out.write(next); }        else{        	Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; x = new TreeMap&lt;Integer, String&gt;();        	x.put(0, next);        	x.put(1,""Should be user input"");        	Set&lt;String&gt; s = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();        	s = corr.getCorrections(next);        	List&lt;String&gt; sortedOptions = new LinkedList&lt;String&gt;(s);        	Collections.sort(sortedOptions);        	System.out.print(""The word: \"" ""+next+""\""is not in the dictionary. \n Please enter the number corresponding with the appropriate action:\n"");        	System.out.println(""0: Ignore and continue"");        	System.out.println(""1: Replace with another word"");        	        	for(String awesome : sortedOptions){        		x.put(sortedOptions.indexOf(awesome)+2, awesome);        		System.out.println(sortedOptions.indexOf(awesome)+2 + "": replace with ""+ awesome+""\"""");        	}        	int num = getNextInt(0, x.size()-1, sc) ;        	if(num == 0){        		out.write(x.get(0));        	}        	else if(num == 1){        		out.write(getNextString(sc));        	}        	else{        		out.write(x.get(num));        	}      	        }        }    }
	When I run spellcheckrunner, nothing prints in the console aside from:
usage: java SpellCheckRunner &lt;in&gt; &lt;out&gt; &lt;dictionary&gt; &lt;corrector&gt;&lt;corrector&gt; is either SWAP, LEV, or a path to a corrections file.

Does this mean my spellchecker is wrong? There are clearly print statements in my spellchecker and I don't see why those would not print.	In the instructions, it specifies that the static type of the collection must be an interface. However, if I want to keep track of past moves using a linked list, I can't call ""removeLast"" if the static type is Collections&lt;E&gt; instead of LinkedList&lt;E&gt;. Are we expected to write out own removeLast and addLast functions? 	I am slightly confused on linked list implementation. 
I have a private field that is 
 private List&lt;Integer[][]&gt; myList;
and then instantiating the list in my constructor as 
  this.myList = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();
. 
I have a later method that calls the removeLast() function for linked lists but for some reason when I call it (myList.removeLast()) I get an error that says the method is undefined for the type List&lt;Integer[][]&gt;. Is there something I'm missing?	
In the example of question 4, why wouldn't this throw a NullPointerException for the same reason for the answer to part 4d? If p1 is null, then calling this.p2.equals(p1) would cause an exception. 

For question 5a, even though there is no deduction on the rubric, syntactically, would input[i].length() cause an error because of the parentheses?


For part 6a, would TreeSet&lt;String&gt; not be allowed because the static type of set is Set&lt;String&gt;?
For e, would Set&lt;Set&lt;String&gt;&gt; not be allowed because the .values() method returns a Collection. But if you can't instantiate collections, what would the dynamic type of f be? 


For part 7a, why is the second efficient but not the first?

Thanks!

Should I still keep the if statement since it would be more efficient (i.e if the nickname is not in the map that I can just go straight to -1?)

For the get Nickname, I was wondering about the javadoc for get method. It says ""Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key."" Does this include the case when the key is not even present in the map? (or would it return an error)

If there is no match found then my function returns null (which then triggers the Error no_such_user) According to the InviteByOwner test there should be a user who's nickname matches and hence I should not be getting a null and should not be getting Error 403	Should the userID be final? We're never supposed to change it correct? Only the nickname changes. 	It says the two Nickname command error conditions, but I am confused on what exactly we have to do with those? I created a changeNickname method in Server model and I call it in command to create that nickname. I also check for validity of that nickname using the isValid, so I am bit confused as to where those are coming in this program. 	Is there supposed to be something stopping me from passing the incorrect nickname (constructor parameter 2).

Do I have to do something to check for this?

I'm thinking maybe it is the part where I remove the channel if it is the owner that is deregisterring, but I tried doing this with a separate iterator and this didn't change the issue...

This is my function:

public Broadcast deregisterUser(int userId) {
    	Integer myInt = new Integer(userId);
    	String name = users.get(userId);
    	users.remove(myInt, name);
    	Collection&lt;String&gt; recipients = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();
    	Collection&lt;Channel&gt; channelSet = new TreeSet&lt;Channel&gt;();
    	channelSet = this.channels.values();
    	Iterator&lt;Channel&gt; itr = channelSet.iterator();
    	while (itr.hasNext()) {
    		Channel current = itr.next();
    		String ownerName = current.getOwner().getValue();
    		Collection&lt;String&gt; members = current.getChannelMembers();
			recipients.addAll(members);
			//System.out.println(recipients.toString());
			if (ownerName.equals(name)) {	
				this.removeChannel(current.getName());
			}
			
    	}
    	//System.out.println(recipients.toString());
    	recipients.remove(name);
    	return Broadcast.disconnected(name, recipients);
    }  
	I'm not sure why my deregister is throwing a null pointer exception at the bolded line- I thought my if statement ensured that a user with the username exists and that there would be a user to remove...
public Broadcast deregisterUser(int userId) {
    	
    	Iterator&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Channel&gt;&gt; channelIter = server.entrySet().iterator();
    	Collection&lt;String&gt; usersToBroadcastTo = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();
    
    	while(channelIter.hasNext()) {
    		Channel channel = channelIter.next().getValue();
    		String owner = channel.getOwner();
			usersToBroadcastTo = getUsersInChannel(channel.channelName);
    		
    		// iterate through all users and remove the user if they're in the channel
    		Iterator&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String,Integer&gt;&gt; iter = channel.channel.entrySet().iterator();
    		while (iter.hasNext()) {
    		    Map.Entry&lt;String, Integer&gt; users = iter.next();
    		    String username = users.getKey();
    			Integer id = users.getValue();
    			if (userId == id) { 
    				if(username == owner) { //if the user is the owner, we have to destroy the channel
    					channelIter.remove();
                    } 
    				else {
            			usersToBroadcastTo.remove(username);

    				}
    				iter.remove();
    			} 
    		}
    		
    	}    	
        // Return broadcast upon user deregistration
        return Broadcast.disconnected(getNickname(userId), usersToBroadcastTo);
    }
	So I'm testing my getUsersInChannel for encapsulation and I made sure that the collection it returns is a copy (I did the same for the function that getUsersInChannel calls (from the Channel class). Making a copy of the collection worked for encapsulating getUsers and getChannels, so I don't know why it isn't working here.

On another note, when I changed my getUsers function from my Channel class, it made another test fail that passed when I didn't make this change. It made a test I wrote for JoinCommand fail when a user joins a channel they're already a member of. Does the submission testing look for when a member tries to join a group it is already a part of? Or can I just get rid of this test. I know I don't have to handle the case separately, but I find it weird that the test passes when I don't fix encapsulation for getUsers in the Channel class, but it fails when I change that.

Here is my code for my getUsersInChannel:

public Collection&lt;String&gt; getUsersInChannel(String channelName) {
    	Collection&lt;String&gt; members = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();
    	Set&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Channel&gt;&gt; channelsSet = this.channels.entrySet();
    	Iterator&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Channel&gt;&gt; itr = channelsSet.iterator();
    	while (itr.hasNext()) {
    		Channel current = itr.next().getValue();
        	if (current.getName().equals(channelName)) {
        		members.addAll(current.getChannelMembers());
        	}
        }
        return members;
    }
and here is my getChannelMembers function from my Channel class.
public Collection&lt;String&gt; getChannelMembers() {
		Collection&lt;String&gt; members = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();
	    members.addAll(this.channelMembers.values());
		return members;

"	If the input is just an LLeaf for parent_child_hamming, should the function return 0?	Hi, I'm a bit confused as to when I should use commas, semicolons or nothing to separate my items when they are an input for a function, or being defined as arguments for constructing something etc.

For example, when constructing a labeled tree of depth 3,
Would it be
(LNode
  (LNode (LLeaf [x], [x], LLeaf [x])),  [A; A],   (LNode (LLeaf [x], [x], LLeaf [x])) )
I keep getting the error that the expression has type 'a * 'b * 'c instead of a labeled tree	I'm writing test cases for Problem 5 for unlabel_tree() and I'm having some trouble. Here is the tree I'm trying to create:
         
                        A
                      /    \
                    T      G
                  /   \    /   \
                C    T G    T

And here is the test case:

let test () : bool =  unlabel_tree (LNode(LNode(LLeaf[C], [T], LLeaf[T],[A], LNode(LLeaf[G], [G], LLeaf[T])))) = ;; run_test ""unlabel_tree depth-3 tree"" test
The error is ""LNode expects 3 arguments but is applied to 1"" Am I missing a parenthesis somewhere?	Sorry about the accidental double post!

So for: parent_child_hamming (LNode (LLeaf [G; T], [A; T],
                  LNode (LLeaf [T; T], [T; T], LLeaf [C; G]))) would that be a 4 (using [A; T] as parents for ALL child (leaf) calculations? 
Or 3 if I use the respective Node Label for each node when calculating their parent-child (leaf) hamming distances?	For Parent_Child_Hamming, I wanted to verify assumptions:

1) If passed simplest variant, LLeaf[], should that return a 0?
2) If passed next simplest variant: LNode (LLeaf[], [], LLeaf[]), should that also be a 0?
3) If passed next simple variant: LNode (LLeaf[C], [C], LLeaf[C]), my assumption should also be 0.
3) If passed next simple variant: LNode (LLeaf[C], [A], LLeaf[A]), my assumption would be 1, since only diff is LLeaf[C] to label [A].
4) If passed a more complex example, say:

(LNode (LLeaf [G; T], [A; T], LNode (LLeaf [T; T], [T; T], LLeaf [C; G]))), I wanted to verify assumptions
  a) if basing parent on just node labels at the node level, I would assume it'd be 3.
       LLeaf[G; T] to Parent label [A;T] = 1
       LLeaf[C; G] to it's parent label [T;T] = 2 (since C-&gt;T and G-&gt;T)...
      So a total of 3
  b) But would you also count node-to-node based on parent labels?
      so LNode [A;T] to LNode [T;T] labels, which would be an additional 1 (A-&gt;T), bringing total to 4?
  c) or would this in fact only be 2? (Not sure which assumptions apply to this problem)...Which assumptions make sense?
	if only a LLeaf of any value is the input for parent_child_hamming, should the function always return 0?	what should this return? 

parent_child_hamming (LNode (LLeaf [G; T], [A; T], LNode (LLeaf [T; T], [T; T], LLeaf [C; G])))

I was thinking 5, but is that incorrect?	parent_child_hamming (LNode (LLeaf [], [T; A], LNode (LLeaf [A; A], [A; A],  LLeaf [G; C]))) 

if there was a statement like the one above, with a depth-3 list and one of the leafs is empty like the left one above, what would the statement produce?

d.move(5.0, 10.0);Shape s = p;

Circle c = new Oval();
Shape s = new Shape();
s = c;

I know the static type will be Shape, but will the dynamic type for s be Oval or Circle?	For example, if you were to have in Java:

Shape s = Circle c;

if getCircumference() is a method only in circle, would you be able to call it on s?	Can you please explain why the answer is the second one and not the first one?

"	On average, how long should it take to run the reducePalette function?  The method I wrote works but when I try to reduce the palette for the stock image to the 512 colors used on the assignment page, it takes 6 seconds to do so.  Are 6 seconds fine or will the auto-grader timeout?	is 4.164 seconds too long for the reduce palette test in eclipse?	I have improved the time from 20 seconds to 10 seconds. However, this is still much too long to pass the tests at submission. I verified my number of for loops at TA office hours, and I am only calling getBitMap() once. I am not sure how else to reduce the time it takes. Any help would be greatly appreciated!	My ReducePalette compiles and tests without error, but it always takes at least a few seconds, which would run over the cutoff time. Is there any way to reduce the running time of ReducePalette?	How long should it take to run this test? Mine's taking 1.69 seconds - is that too long?	I manually allowed the test to run all the way through, and got the following exceptions. Are they normal for inefficient code? Why would permission be denied? It is still saying ""fail on timeout"" for two of the lines in the trace, but it ends at the same time (admittedly very long - 10 seconds) no matter how long I make the time.



 	When I run my test cases on Ecllipse, they take 2-4 seconds each, but when I run them on Codio, they only take around 0.004 seconds. I'm not sure why this is the case. Could it be that my computer is just slow, and will this affect grading?	Is having a test that takes 11 seconds too long?"
"	Whenever I draw an ellipse, it draws it and then all my widgets disappear and the program essentially just stops with the one drawn ellipse on the screen, I don't know what's wrong.	when I'm drawing the ellipse in paint, the mouse stays at the center of the ellipse rather than at the corners. Any tips on fixing this?	Do we need to account when ellipse is drawn the other way ? Like clicked on the right side and dragged towards the left ? 	After I draw the first ellipse, all of the others draw randomly when I just click. I am unable to change the center position and size for subsequent ellipses.   	I wrote a new draw ellipse function (draw_ellipse2) that implements the original draw ellipse function (draw_ellipse) but when I try to use it in my repaint function I get a unbound module error. Why isn't my function being registered? 	I implemented ellipse in a way that is similar to line and points (or so I thought), but when I click on the Ellipse button and then try to draw an ellipse, it doesn't draw anything and all of the toolbar and color widgets disappear.	Now when I do it, the ellipses draw on the screen and the widgets don't disappear, but they show up in the top left corner and don't seem to be drawn correctly. I feel like this is something to do with graphics context, but I don't see why this would be any different for ellipse than for line or points.	I have implemented a drawing ellipses function but my ellipse expands from the center instead of using the bounding box method (even though that's what I tried to do). How can I fix this? 	Hello, I have managed to write the implementation for ellipse however there seems to be a bug that I cannot find. My program successfully draws ellipses however it is able to draw them outside of the ""paint canvas"". Where might I look to modify my code to restrict drawing of ellipses only to the canvas like the implementations of line and points.

Thanks :)	In task 4 I've coded the ellipse function using what I think is the bounding box method, but I'm not sure. I think the math is right, but when I draw the ellipse, the mouse stays in the upper left hand corner of the ellipse, so that feels wrong. I feel like the mouse should be in the upper right hand going through the ellipse, but no matter how I manipulate the code, I can't seem to get it to do that. 

Basically, is my task 4 correct for the bounding box method or is my math still wrong?	I am having a problem, that each time I draw an ellipse, no matter where I click, it takes in the first point to be (0,0) and makes the ellipse with that as the first corner. How can I fix this?	I don't know why after I clicked the ellipse button, clicked on the drawing area and dragged the mouse, nothing showed up on the screen, and even the buttons all disappeared.	I implemented ellipse, but an issue I noticed is that when I draw one ellipse, it starts from the size of the previous ellipse. In other words, the ellipses' radius are only bigger than the previous ellipse's radius. Also, all my ellipses start from the top left corner, instead of bottom left. Any suggestions? 	After I started task 5, I noticed an issue popped up with drawing ellipses, in which the program just stops after I draw two ellipses. I can draw as many lines and points and change colors, but looking at my paint_action function, I'm struggling to understand why I'm only able to draw two ellipses before the program stops working. How do I begin to identify where to fix my problem?	I think the problem actually occurs when I try to draw the ellipse by dragging in any way other than top left to bottom right. Is this an issue related to passing in negative values somehow, and how do I think about fixing this?	My ellipse only stays fixed if I draw it from the bottom right corner to the top left corner. Is my math wrong?	I implemented the Drawing Ellipses Problem in Task 4 the same way that we implemented the drag and drop line, however, in my paint application, it doesn't switch to drawing ellipses when I click the Ellipse button, it either draws lines or points depending on what was last selected. I've checked that I correctly implemented the mode and the repaint function but I don't know where the problem is.	I am done with p4 but have an error in repaint for drawing ellipses. 
When I draw an ellipse, the radius is always a little bigger than expected--the border of the ellipse goes beyond where my mouse position is. 
I think everything else works correctly--just not sure why this is happening.	I have implemented everything for drawing Ellipses. All the other functionalities work correctly, but when I click on the ellipse button and try to draw an ellipse, my entire mode tool bar and color tool bar disappear and no ellipse can be drawn. 	My ellipse is being drawn very far from the cursor, but the previewing and drawing is working properly. The more right I take the cursor, the more left the ellipse is drawn. What might I be doing wrong?	I haven't implemented thickness yet, but the problem before was two-fold:

one, it was going way outside the box, but I made the formula wrong, so I fixed that.

The second problem is that if I make an ellipse that hits the edge, making a new ellipse gets really finicky, i.e. i can't draw a new one without insuring that the old one is not close to the edge. I assume this is ok?"

isn't fun of type 'a -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list
and fold is of type ('a -&gt; 'b-&gt; 'b)-&gt;'b -&gt;'a list-&gt; 'b from function definition

So the type of this function should be (''a -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list)-&gt;'a list -&gt;'a list-&gt; 'a list ?	Why is this 'a list -&gt; 'a list -'a list. Shouldn't it be a' -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list because to cons something it must be a'::'a list?
If both inputs are 'a list then we need to use the @ operator?

I know some people have a midterm overlapping that time and it seems logical to have 2 review sessions because not  everyone may be able to make one time. Thank you! 	Will there be recitations on 10/10?	Why does a (good_style  bad_grade -10) create the grade -10? Isn't bad_grade always equal to 0 no matter what the input? 	Hi, I'm a bit confused as to what reducePalette is supposed to do. From my understanding, we're supposed to create a mapping of each pixel color to its frequency (so, if Pixel(10, 10, 10) appears 20 times in the image, the pixel would map to 20).

Then, we need to create a palette of pixels that have the highest color frequency. Say 20 is the max, then my palette would be those 20 pixels that have color r=10, g=10, b=10.

I don't really understand what ""Then change each pixel in the picture to one with the closest matching color from your palette"" means.	I've pasted the ""interesting test"" for reducePalette below.  It fails, but passes if I make the 0s into 10s and 10s into 0s in s (ie, 
PixelPicture s = threeStripes(10,10,10,255,255,255,0,0,0)instead of PixelPicture s = threeStripes(0,0,0,255,255,255,10,10,10)

I put the pixels into ColorMap in ascending order, incrementing x in the outer loop. And I compare against the sorted ColorMap choosing the higher frequency (ie, nearer to the head of the sorted ColorMap) if the colors are equally distance.  Is there any chance the test it wrong?  It's hard for me to tell what the sorting algorithm is in getSorted in ColorMap for colors with the same frequency (would 0,0,0 go before 10,10,10? Is it based on which goes in first?)

Thanks!

        PixelPicture s = threeStripes(0,0,0,255,255,255,10,10,10);

                     );
    }
	Say, the normalized value for the intensity of the red component of a pixel is 12 and the average for the entire image is 20. I normalize it: 20-12 = -8. And then I scale it: -8 *1.2 = -10. Should I be adding the average before it's been clipped, so -10 + 20 = 10, or after it's been clipped, 0 + 20 = 20?

"	Looking at the solutions, it seems as though if the arrays are indexed like arr[columns][rows]. For example, in Q5b ii. and iii. wouldn't the width going in the first slot of the array suggest that the array is indexed like arr[columns][rows] (because the width should specify the number of columns). And the same thing for the height and rows.

However, in appendix C, the bitmap is described as being indexed as arr[rows][columns], in other words as arr[y][x] (since the x coordinate represents the column number and vice versa).

Can someone clarify the indexing of the 2D arrays?

"	My first failure when I submitted the homework was: ""deregister sends disconnected appropriately to multiple channels.""

I am a bit confused on what this means. My code adds all users who were in a channel with the disconnected user to a set of users to be notified. I am not necessarily supposed to send this to ""multiple channels,"" just users from any channel that the original user was in, right?

Here is my code for this method:

    	// delete user from the channels they are in

            if (c.containsUser(userId)) {
            	//remove the user from that channel

            }
        }

    }

Do you have any advice for where I should look while debugging this?

	Regarding 2D, if all were defined in the interface, would there be an error caused by the fact that one was using the dot notation when it isn't necessary? Also, assuming it were defined in the interface, would there be an error due to the fact that you are passing it an empty set, but it is expecting a list (even though this is how it is implemented behind the scenes)? Thanks. 	I have updated with the error codes. The program isn't compiling.	Why does it still say syntax error after unclosed (, even though I added the brackets? 	How would we match for just None? If we just do those two examples it gives an error saying it isn't exhausitve.	Inside my if... then... else statement in linkedQueues truncate, I'm trying to run two unit commands after the then (separated by ;). However, every time I try to do that, the else shows an error of ""Syntax error after unclosed began, expecting 'end'

Why is this happening?

I have been receiving this error since I started the homework: 
File ""simpleQueue.ml"", line 42, characters 3-6:

I'm not sure what I changed to yield this error, why would 'let' be classified as a syntax error?	Hi, i'm trying to write SimpleQueue and when i run the program it says I have a syntax error in line 44, character 2-5 (which is the function to_list already given, and character 2-5 is ""let"" in the first line of this function). Both the function before this and after this are all already given. And there is no red dot.

Is it okay to proceed with the homework without importing this? I am running Eclipse.	Ok, so it is failing the Assert #2. That means that User 0 is still in Java when they should not be. My question is, what method exactly is ""testNickBroadcastsToChannelWhereMemeber"" testing and why should I be removing a person during that? It seems to me that it should more be testing the messaging system in which case I am not sure why Assert 2 would matter. The only line it gives me for error is the one in the test file, line 76. I think because it is an error, not a failure it doesnt give more information. 	Since the status of compilation depends on if there is a compile time error, and since the status of running thoroughly depends on if there is a run time error, there is no possible scenario where code can both not compile and have an exception, right?

	Like, can we use == between integers? If not, why error will that pop?

Right now I'm trying to create and return an error broadcast in the updateServerModel of NicknameCommand.

"	In my Channels class I have a public method called getUsers, which returns a COPY of the set of users contained within the channel.

In ServerModel I have a public method to allow Command access to that set of users in a channel; in this method I also return a COPY of that set. 

My question is: which ""copy"" is necessary--the one that Channel returns or the one ServerModel returns? Or is it ok to keep both? (ie. should channel return the actual data set of users within the channel and then ServerModel makes a copy?)

"	How do I test if my draw_point and draw_points functions are correct?	I am having the same problem. I think it is because the instructions say to use draw_points in repaint, but I can't because draw_points takes in a position list and the Points shape holds a point list.
How do I make draw_points work for the Points shape if I can't change the headers of the functions?	I implemented draw_point and draw_points but no points are showing up when I click in the canvas. draw_point is VERY similar to draw_rect, why isn't anything showing up?	Yes, I understand that that function you're speaking of is draw_point which we implemented earlier but the types don't match.

For example in draw_points, p is a list and, 

 List.iter f p

Where here f is a function that draws one point. The only function that does this is draw_point so if we substitute draw_point for f

(List.iter drawpoint g p)

Produces a type error because draw_point takes in a point, not  a point list. But in doing something like 

let f = (fun (""I don't know what goes here)"" -&gt; unit ()) in

I'm not sure how to set f to draw_point while it's missing the point parameter. I've reviewed the lecture notes on partial applications but I'm still lost.	When we use functions that we wrote such as draw_point within paint.ml, do we need to say Gctx.draw_point ... or just draw_point... 

Same question for Widget.hpair... vs hpair.... within the paint.ml file	Line 99 of my paint.ml file is:

| Points (c, p) -&gt; draw_points (with_params g c) p

I double checked my draw_points and draw_point functions in the gctx.ml files and they seem fine, but I'm getting an Unbound value draw_points when I try to compile my code.

When I run lightbulb, I get two black boxes with the labels to the right of each, and when I click on the corresponding label, the box changes color. However, the drawing of a rectangle and an ""X"" is irrelevant in lightbulb, so do I just draw the ""X"" in my implementation within paint? In that case, what is repaint doing in Widget.checkbox?	For some reason, even though I am passing in a black graphics context to draw_rect in my sliders function, it is drawing multicolored borders around where the red, green, and blue sliders get painted, instead of black borders. What could be the reason for this bug? Or, is this okay?

Here is my code: 

let slider (pos: int) (c: Gctx.color) : widget * int value_controller =
  let new_control : int value_controller = make_control pos in
  let width, height = (255, 10) in
  { repaint = (fun (g: Gctx.gctx) -&gt; 
        Gctx.draw_rect (Gctx.with_color g Gctx.black) (0, 10) (width, height); 
        Gctx.fill_rect (Gctx.with_color g c) (0, 10) (new_control.get_value(), height));
    handle = (fun (g: Gctx.gctx) (e: Gctx.event) -&gt;

          else new_control.change_value (fst (Gctx.event_pos e g))));
    size = (fun () -&gt; (width, height))}, new_control

It is still showing colored borders unfortunately. 	I really don't know where I'm going wrong.

"	should we be using value_controller and make_control in a new slider widget?	I was thinking about the drag element of the slider and was unsure whether we should be matching on MouseDrag in repaint for our slider widget	So are we erasing the slider when we drag backwards?	My slider is behaving strangely. I am able to change color, but the bar in the slider is either full or none. What is wrong with my code? 	I'm a little confused about how to access the mouse coordinates in repaint for my slider. I have it figured out for handle, but since repaint does not allow for matching on events, how can I capture the value that I have in handle and use it to redraw the slider?	For the slider should clicking the text bring the slider to the maximum value? Assuming the text is to the right of the slider.	can I try to add a slider for something else, such as thickness, in part 6?	After I fix those errors and run paint, the color slider fails to draw on the screen. Any idea to what might be wrong? I have initialized the slider length to be 20. 	Are we required to have a label for our slider (I made a thickness slider)?	If we make a thickness slider, do we have to display the numerical value of the line thickness next to it? Or can we just have the slider?	Is it OK for our slider to only work with floats? 	I decided to create a new shape ""circles"" and a slider that controls the size...when the size is large, parts of the circles are drawn off of the canvas. Where should I account for this bug and write ""if"" statements with the radii so that it never goes off of the canvas? I know that my slider should stay generic...	So I have three sliders set up and they show the right behavior in responding to clicks and drags, but in order for a slider to respond, the mouse click/drag must be between its bottom border up to a full height of the slider below the bottom. I think this has something to do with my handle function within my slider widget.

In handle I check whether the event_type is MouseDown or MouseDrag. I've tried checking the position of the event within handle to try to limit this behavior, but it hasn't helped at all.	For some reason, my slider only fills up when I click outside of the rectangle used to represent this. I have narrowed it down to being an issue with the size of the widget (if I increase the size's height, then clicks farther outside the rectangle work), but I don't know how to make the size correspond to the inside of the rectangle. 
Any tips? 

Figured it out	In task 6, I have sliders implemented as shown here but there is some weird behavior with the lines around them at the right side. Additionally, similar to @1812 my sliders only work when I click or drag within one slider height above each's top edge. How should I go about fixing this?
	I fixed the fill_rect placement issue but clicking/dragging above the slider still changes it.	How should I update the width of the filled rectangle drawn inside the slider? I currently draw a rectangle with the width being the value stored in the value controller both when in MouseUp and MouseDrag.

I also update the value in the value controller to the x value of position in both MouseUp and MouseDrag.

	will points be taken off from style if my slider displays its location through only a line and not a filled in rectangle?	I eliminated the slider type, but my slider widget still has odd compiler errors.	I implemented slider, and now I'm trying to add a color slider so that it appears on the screen and I can test it.

However, when I add a slider in paint_widget and then run paint again, not only does the slider not work but everything else in the program stops working (it only draws lines). Any ideas what might be wrong?	Edit -- everything works as normal, except my slider doesn't do anything 	I have implemented the same, and I was wondering if it's fine when the checkbox is not clicked, the slider moves although it doesn't actually change the thickness ?	I added a slider for thickness. Is that accepted?	I am trying to make a thickness slider for Task 6. The part I am confused is how to make a scale. I am not sure what values does the p for mouseDrag output. Is it the from the same range as of the rectangle I made ?
	Thank you for responding:

I have tried changing the x and y values because previous they didn't factor in the value controller as an input.

The slider should update the value of the controller in a given range of coordinates, the size of the rectangle. The line should then be redrawn to the new x value of the mouses position while its being dragged or clicked. Listeners should be updated (I have not gotten to that yet).

The value controller should be updating properly, as it updated properly for my checkbox, and I'm using the same widget *value controller set up to create the slider. 

My apologies for giving little context. Any other thoughts? I think the problem is somewhere in handle but I can't figure out where.	i am trying to implement my thickness slider so that when the checkbox isnt checked, the slider is all white, and cant be moved. I am not sure how to implement this. Am I supposed to change repaint and handle in my thickness_slider widget in the paint.ml file? Is this even possible? I have tried doing it but always get type errors. any tips would be much appreciated	Now it's not giving the ""make: nothing to be done for all"" error but it is still not building paint correctly. It will draw out the canvas, the mode toolbar, and one of the three sliders that should be in the rgb toolbar (and the slider does not work), and nothing below that. None of the functionality works. 

If I don't add the rgb toolbar to the paint_widget, then everything works perfectly again (without the sliders). I keep looking through my slider code and can't see what might be messing things up?	I am having this weird bug in that when the slider is clicked on or dragged and the thick checkbox is selected, the thickness of the object drawn can also be changed when being dragged in the canvas. I know my slider is not repainting correctly at the moment, but I feel like the 2 functionalities should be independent? Where am I allowing the thickness of the drawn object to be constantly changed?	If you click line, after checking the checkbox  and dragging the slider, the line can be dragged down to basically make a rectangle of different width.	For my slider, I am stuck on how I can the filled rectangle to stay filled after I move my mouse away from the slider. I was thinking of putting it into the deque of shapes but shapes doesn't have a type of filled rectangle.	Do we need to implement a general functionality for setting/getting the initial string passed to the checkbox/slider widgets?	Do I HAVE to make the slider take in the max position when it's constructed? Or am I allowed to have it begin at the minimum value without passing in anything explicitly? 	Thank you! Is this logical implementation feasible though?
The slide controller is supposed to hold the percentage of the widget that the slider is on (left most point being 0% and right most point being 100% and maxi is supposed to be the maximum value that a slider can hold).

Is there a more logical/straight forward way to implement this?	Is it possible for me to add two value controllers for the slider?
i.e. 1) bool value controller for bool value if the slider is checked
2) int value controller for the int value of the slider indicator


	I am working on a color slider, and I am having trouble getting the slider rectangle to slide. I have looked at the other posts on this topic, and I don't see why my slider isn't working. I know one of the posts talked about handling drawing the filled rectangle in the widget repaint, but then it makes it more difficult for me to set the color (or slider would have to take a different parameter); I'm trying to handle drawing the slider in a way similar to lightbulb. Is this possible? Any suggestions here would be appreciated.	I tried to fix this, but now there are two rectangles being drawn and the slider still doesn't work. I'm puzzled about the two rectangles, and I'm still a little confused about handling the drawing of the slider. 	I want to pass in the value of x1 (the x value of where the mouse is). This will be the point in the slider that the person is sliding the bar to	When I start dragging on one of my color sliders and then continue to drag onto another slider, the value of this second slider also changes, even though I did not start dragging on it. Is this acceptable behavior? If not, how would I go about fixing it?	Is the following acceptable in an implementation of slider for line thickness: Having the line width = 10 when you click the thick width box, regardless of the status of the slider, and the line width varying according to the slider only when you mutate the slider in the thick width mode.

i.e. slider initially be set at width = 5, checkbox = skinny lines.  Clicking the thick line will have width of 10, not 5. Sliding the slider to 6 will set it from 10 to 6.	My color slider almost works except it is sensing clicks that are slightly above the widget. I thought this might be an issue with size but size seems to be correct. Any ideas what might be wrong?	My slider works in that it changes the thickness of the line drawn accordingly, however whenever you click anywhere in the slider it automatically fills the whole slider. I know this is a bug with either handle and/or repaint, but I can't figure out where. Help please!	Why is it that when I set the lower left coordinate to (0,0) for the slider that it appears inside the canvas and not on the toolbar--- but this works if I do (20,20)?	In many of the examples we see on the documentation for Hmwrk 5, there is another current color box beside the slider. Are we expected to implement this as well or can we just implement the slider?	 
Is it because I have the third slider below the window? I need to scroll down a little to see that sli
	My slider colors work but the slider itself doesn't slide. Whenever I click it, the filled rectangle goes all the the way off the screen.

I'm pretty sure my widget code is right - could this be because of how I set up things in paint? 
	Should I have implemented slider with a notifier controller, or is this possible to do with simply a value controller and widget? I tried adding a change listener that changed the value stored in the slider, but I dont think this is updated because clicking the color buttons is an event outside the slider. I thought about calling either repaint or handle for the sliders inside the color button, but they both require a gctx input...	Hi, my slider now can only allow me to click once which will fill out the whole bar. However, before I added ""(Gctx.with_color g c)"" in the slider function, I was able to drag (just the color was wrong since it was black). I did not modify anything else. Any suggestions for what's causing this problem? Thanks!	How do I make it so if I click the slider, the checkbox for thick lines is automatically filled?

I am really confused what this means, and also what I should do to fix it. My code runs and compiles fine and passes the tests that I have, so I don't know what this means.	
So I’m working in Eclipse and last night, I completed the final task so I zipped the required files (directly from Eclipse) and used my first submission (on the Codio Submission site) to see where I stand on the automatically graded tests. Unfortunately, there were some errors, as you can see in the screenshot I attached to this post. Aside from the fact that it didn’t like how I named my zip file, I also got a score of 23.0/80.0 based on tests, which surprised me since I had been passing all the initially given test. Although my code compiled (thus using up 1 of my 3 free submissions) the first error was listed as “User cannot be cast to java.lang.Comparable” which leads me to believe that many of the other failures are simply because the User class I made did not implement the Comparable&lt;User&gt; interface (which I have since fixed).

Thanks	
say I'm trying to add 2 into a bag containing, [(1,1);(3,1)], won't this code fail the invariants since it will simply add 2 to the beginning of the bag?	but isn't 2 con-ed to the head of b, which is the original bag?	let c : _________ = add (add 1 empty) empty
So I thought this would be ill-typed. Here's my thought process
val add : 'a -&gt; 'a bag -&gt; 'a bag
Since 1 is an int then the type of (add 1 empty) should be int -&gt; int bag -&gt; int bag
This means that when (add 1 empty) is applied to the outer add function, add is taking in an int bag and an empty bag
But the input of add should be 'a and 'a bag. So add (add 1 empty) empty is ill-typed.

	right i see what ur logic is
what i'm not understanding is why 'a would correspond to int bag	let g : _________ = ( fun x -&gt; equals x x)
val equals : 'a bag -&gt; 'a bag -&gt; bool
Why is the answer ('a bag) -&gt; bool (also why is there a parenthesis around 'a bag).
I thought t would be 'a bag -&gt; ' a bag -&gt; bool since nothing is applied to the anon. func.	then why isn't it 'a bag -&gt; 'a bag -&gt; bool?"

"
"	Hi, I'm making Whack a Mole, so when I am implementing the collection, I cannot use ""undo"", so I decided to do a replay button, so basically when the user hits the replay button, so situation of the last round of game will be presented in the order of the way the user played last round. 

I'm not sure about how to write the replay method in the GameCourt- Do I use another timer? So that it can replay the situation? 

I attached the image of my tick() here, so that you know how I store value for my linked list (below the repaint at the end of tick()):



	Just to confirm ur suggested idea: 

I add a private boolean to the GameCourt, to check if the user clicks on the replay button or not. If yes, then the boolean is set to true, so basically, I do some changes to the tick() I have right now: if the boolean is set to true, I don't go into the right-now code, I make it go through the list I have and repaint every tick()?

So it's like,

if (isReplay) {
    (loop through the LinkedList) {
        paint each element (which is the 2d array / the game board)
    }
} else {
 // and here is the code I have in the tick() for now , as indicated by the screenshot I attached above
}

Is this general logic right?	Hi, I'm using collections to store the whole 2d array every tick() into a linked list, so that I can replay the whole last round of game like a little animation when I hit the replay button. But now when I hit the replay button, I'm getting this kind of exception. I don't what that means, but seems to be something wrong with my iterator for the linked list. Can someone tell me what this error means? Thanks!


This is the line 116 for my iterator in my tick(). I put this into tick() because I have two boolean private fields, playing and isReplay. If playing is true and isReplay is false, then I just do the game logic. If playing is false and isReplay is true, I go into another set of code, which is iterating through the list and every interval make the 2d array into the current element of the list, so this can be an animation. 

	Hi, thank you for pointing this out, put my game logic seems to not have this kind of problem, because I add elements to the list when ""play is true and isReplay is false"", and I iterate from the list when ""play is false and isReplay is true"". These cannot be happening at the same time, how can I be modifying and calling it at the same time? 



This is my tick(). when I play the game, it randomly make each position to be tile or mole; when I hit replay, it shows the last round in a timely order as an animation. Can you give me some tips about what can possiblity causing such problems? Thanks!!	Hi, I realized the concurrent error is happening because I initialized my iterator at the top of the private field. Now I've changed it and the concurrent is no longer happening, but when I click on the replay button, nothing is happening, it's like, my button does not work. I'm at OH but it is still... Plz help.

This is my private field in GameCourt

This is my tick(), and we only need to look at the else if (!playing &amp;&amp; isReplay). I have a print out statement there and I have checked that it indeed can enter into that loop.


This is my replay button in the Game.
	Hi, I'm making whack a mole, and I want to use collection for a replay button- this button is for redisplay the situation of last round in a timely order like an animation/film clip. But right now, when I hit the replay button, there is nothing on the screen- nothing is repainted when it should start displaying the last round's situation like an animation.

I stored the state of my whole 2d array in the linked list every interval, and when the game is ended, I create the iterator of the linked list so that there won't be any concurrent complier prob when I enter the else if clause of replay. 


This is my tick(), as you can see, I instantiate my iterator when the round of game ends. And when isReplay is set true, I enter the loop beneath. And if you look at my last image in this post, when I hit replay button, it actually enters the loop and, since I have 8 intervals, it prints out the ""yes"" 8 times. 


This is what my replay button looks like in Game.


As you can see from my console, there are 8 yes's printed out, so my loop/game logic is valid, but somehow the image is not updating, as in there is something wrong with the 2d array I stored in the list. I don't know why. Plz help. I went to the OH today but we still cannot figure that out.

If I am understanding these instructions correctly, we are first checking if there is a value present in paint.preview (Some or none) and then checking again (if there is something) whether or not the list of points (ps) is empty? So would this require two pattern-matches?

Or should I return the non-word token first?	If we had something like this: ""Hello my 14343'143 is what""

Since tokenscanner alternates between words and non-words, would the non-word be "" 14343'143 ""
and then the next word be ""is""? 

If so, when we call next(). would we get "" 14343'143 "" for the non-word?	What if it was ""123name""

Would 123 be the nonword and then 'name' be the word?	For this test case for FileCorrector, ""We ask for a word that has no corrections,"" does this mean that the txt file does not have the word in the file? Does this test expect an error/exception? 

	Is there a reason why my TokenScanner isn't scanning non-word tokens that start the file but is scanning all other non-word tokens (including ones that are at the end file)?	I'm having trouble getting my tokenscanner to alternate between word and nonword tokens...

it seems like it recognizes the first instance as a word, but once it gets to the first nonword character (i.e. whitespace) it skips over it and recognizes the first new word character as the current state of the int variable. 

I think this has something to do with the way I'm updating my .read() method, as in I may be calling it too many times so that it skips over certain characters in the input. Does this make sense at all? 	When my TokenScanner is a string of ""Aren't you /ntired"", my function is recognizing ""Aren't"" as the first word token and returning it in the first call to d.next(). However, because I'm calling rd.read() in my while-loop and again at the beginning of my try-block, I think it's skipping over the whitespace after the ""Aren't"". What should be happening is that when it hits the whitespace, it registers it as a non-word character and funnels through to the else block of this function. 

However, I need to first set a to rd.read() in order to let my function recognize the input. Here, when I call it for the first time, I set ""a"" to ""A"" (for ""Aren't) and that's what gets my function off the ground. Further, I need to increment the ""a"" variable within my while loop so I traverse through the string and print out different things instead of just staying in one place. I'm not sure how to reconcile these. Any suggestions? I've been trying to print to debug and different things, and I just can't seem to get over this hump. 




	public TokenScanner(java.io.Reader in) throws IOException {	r = in;	ch = -1;	tokenScannerReader();}private void tokenScannerReader() throws IOException {	ch = r.read();	while (ch != -1 &amp;&amp; !isWordCharacter(ch)) {		ch = r.read();	}}
This implementation of the TokenScanner works in every instance except when there are non-word tokens at the very beginning of the file. For example, in the gettysburg file, everything matches the output except for the initial spaces on the first line before the word ""Four"". It works when there are non-word tokens that end the file and is picking up all the non-word tokens in the middle of the file. I tried changing the helper function to 

private void tokenScannerReader() throw IOException {	ch = r.read();	if (iwWordCharacter(ch)) {		while (ch != -1 &amp;&amp; !isWordCharacter(ch)) {		ch = r.read();	}	else {		while (ch != -1 &amp;&amp; isWordCharacter(ch)) {			r.read();		}		}	
This passed all of my tests (including the ones where the first token is a non-word token) but it results in a Test Timed Out Exception.

Any advice on how to fix this?	In my implementation for hasNext and next for the token scanner, it seems like the reader is skipping white spaces and returning consecutive word tokens (instead of alternating between word and non-word). I also added some print statements in my code to try and debug, but I'm not sure why this is happening. 

(I copied and pasted my TokenScanner code into codio)	But the word in this case technically should still be corrected to be lower case right? How do I account for that?	This is my code for the next() method. It passes the testGetNextTokenWord test but I don't understand how. 
For the non word "" \n"", it's returning the correct thing. However, I'm not sure how it's doing this.
In the second while loop, I there's a condition that it must not be a word character. However, n is a word character. How come it is still adding to the slash before it?



	So I checked and I actually wasn't using a while loop to read in words, so I at least fixed that.

So isWord is currently working. Right now I convert every word I read in into a lowercase letter first and then store that in my TreeSet in the constructor. But down in isWord I still have to use compareToIgnoreCase in order to pass all my tests. I don't understand why. If every word in my dictionary word list is already lower case, can't I just convert the word I pass into isWord into lowercase and then use compareTo? It doesn't seem like I should need the extra step.	If ""LION"" is the incorrect word, should be we returning ""LION""? 	assertTrue(TokenScanner.isWordCharacter('\'')); I thought word characters were just letters and apostrophes 	In a TreeSet for FileCorrector, should we be storing the correct word and misspelled word individually, or should we store the whole line?	For FileCorrector, are spaces allowed in the wrong word (they are specified as allowed in the right word)?	Hi, 
I believe that my logic is correct however simpleContains test doesn't pass my for code.
I casted the first letter of each word and make it to be the key of the map, the values is a TreeSet of strings whose first letter is the key. I've also handled the case sensitive issue with str.toLowerCase(). Could you give me some hints about where went wrong in my code? I've attached my constructor and isWord(). Thank you so much!

        		}

    }public boolean isWord(String word) {
        if (word == null || !TokenScanner.isWord(word)) {
        	return false;

    	if (dic.containsKey(key)) {
    		return dic.get(key).contains(word.toLowerCase());
    	}
    	return false;
    }
	Right I get that I'm reading it in even though its not part of the word but I'm not sure what's causing that since the while loop should check if it it is a word character before it could get added.

	I am having a hard time adding things to my dictionary because a new line is being counted as a word. I think this comes from \n being seen as a word, which I'm guessing is a problem with my next function. I tried to write a case that
 if(c.equals(""\"") 
then the next character is also added to the current word if it is n, but this is not working, I am getting a problem with finding equality to \. Is there a different way to do this?	When building our dictionary, would we be allowed to convert the word tokens received from our TokenScanner to lowercase to better handle case-sensitivity? 
	Hello! When checking the code I wrote in tokenScanner with my tests, I noticed that my non-word characters were being added to my word characters, and I'm not sure why. I know it's probably something wrong with the way I implemented my next() method in tokenScanner, specifically with the while loops. For example, given the string ""hello_world"", the expected output for scanner.next() is ""hello_"". How do I go about understanding what my issue is? Really appreciate the help!

I tried changing the isWord method to:

    }

Would there be multiple suggestions for one given misspelled word	Is it okay to test only cases described in task such as:
The input is empty.The input contains a single word token.The input contains a single non-word token.The input contains both word tokens and nonword tokens, and ends with a word.The input contains both word tokens and nonword tokens, and ends with a non-word.	Hello! I checked for the FAQ #4 and other piazza posts, but I couldn't find out what I should do if the misspelled word is not a word token. I understand that the suggestion can be a non-word token, but since the getCorrections method returns an exception when the misspelled word is not a word token, I assume it shouldn't be the case. Then, when I create the FileCorrector via a constructor, should I check if the misspelled word is a word token?

Also, I am a bit confused as to when to terminate the loop after doing all the readLine()'s for the bufferedreader. A same piazza post asked the question but he figured it out himself :(. My idea is: since the cursor moves to the end of the cursor everytime we call readLine(), should I be checking for the hasNext()? (But that would lend itself to many errors :( kinda lost ahh) 	Hi! I saw @3289 but I'm still confused. I'm getting a TestTimedOutException for testCheckGettysburgSwap.

I'm almost certain that this is because of my next() method in TokenScanner. 


I don't understand why my next method is not writing down non-word characters at the beginning of a String. It works for the end of a string and next() passes all other custom tests, except non-word beginnings. Why is this? 	My checkDocument is timing out all three tests in SpellCheckerTest and I don't know why.

	Is it possible that if I wrote the option wrong (e.g. I wrote replace it with another word instead of replace with another word), it is the source of my test failure? Does the submission check for this?	What do you mean by non-word? Would we need to define another helper function in there somewhere?

Is this supposed to happen or should it only output one word to handle at a time?

If it's not intended, what might be the cause?	1 potential reason is that my criteria for checking if the word is eligible for a swap is incorrect"
"	I'm trying to do a double match on qnode and qnode.next where both are 'a qnode options

ie, ""begin match qn1, qn1.next""

The remainder of the code is without red dots, but qn1.next says ""this expression has type 'a qnode option, but an expression of type 'b qnode is expected""

Only qn1 is passed to the function, so it seems like the match patterns below are what's causing it to think it should be 'b qnode.  Does that seem right?  I can't see anything in the patterns that would imply 'b qnode...

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!  (this is on bottom on linkedQueue)	How do I return an empty 'a qnode from a 'a qnode option if I'm using pattern matching? 

I can pattern match the 'a qnode option on Some n to return n, but what would I return if 'a qnode option is None?	I don’t need a nonexistent qnode, but then my pattern match cases are not exhaustive. Say, for instance, I want to refer to x.next.next. Since n.next returns a qnode option and .next only works on a qnode, I was thinking of converting the qnode option to a qnode. But if I pattern match qnode option on only Some n -&gt; n, it’s not exhaustive...	If a queue has a cycle does that mean that its tail points to the qnode option whose next is a node that was already seen? Or can the tail be pointed to a separate isolated qnode option?

Thanks	Is it possible to directly pattern match to find out if a qnode is a head or tail?	I've been struggling with the delete function for some time. I understand that I'm getting type errors because the way that my code is structured incorrectly mixes 'a qnode and 'a qnode option, but I can't figure out whether I would need to change the entire structure of my function (pattern match to a 'a qnode option instead of 'a qnode) to get it to compile or whether the problem could be fixed with syntax changes. 	Thank you very much, that was a big help! I still get an error because I make my call to loop using q.head...is there a way to pass in q.head as a 'a qnode instead of a 'a qnode option? 	I'm pattern matching on a 'a qnode option called no, and it's coming up as an error when I try to do no &lt;- n.next. Am I writing this code wrong or is this not possible to do?	I replaced it with the actual qnode options but it still isn't working. 	It's a qnode option, but I don't see how pattern matching is going to solve that problem. You pattern match and check if it's none or some (next value). That still doesn't tell you anything about how to access the downstream node.....	What would happen if we tried to check structural equality between a qnode and a qnode option in OCaml. Would it not compile it OCaml? Why would it not just compile and just give us false as the answer?	Hi, I have 2 follow-up questions on ""why qn2.next == q.tail is false"":

I understand that they are of type 'a qnode option, so they should be pointing to an option, so they are not pointing to the same option, so they are not referentially equal. But,

1. Is there a way to show on the ASM that they are pointing to different options? And in what circumstance two options are referentially equal? Why in this case they are not pointing to the same option? (the more I think the more I'm confused, sorry)? 

2. If we find a way to compare the 'a qnode within their 'a qnode option, then we can say their 'a qnode are referentially equal, right? Because they all point to the same record of 'a qnode? 

Thanks.	I wonder what is the exact difference in these two queues, except that the one has referentially equal 'a qnode option the other only has structurally equal 'a qnode option? 

Does it do any differences to the functionality of the queue's methods? When can a queue's head and tail share the same 'a qnode option? I don't understand.

	Why do the following lines create pointers to the same Some bubbles while something like qn4: int qnode = {v=4; next = Some qn2} would produce another qnode with a pointer to a different Some bubble?

"	I'm on question 6 and I have created a slider for the thickness. Like the instructions suggested the slider will only adjust the thickness of the line if the thick checkbox is checked. However I have encountered one little issue that I am not sure if I need to fix: when I check the thick checkbox, I have a default thick value; if the slider is adjusted before I check the checkbox, the lines are drawn with the default thick value instead of the slider thick value. Is this ok? It only works if you adjust the slider after you check the checkbox. 	So I implemented a thickness slider and I just had a couple of questions regarding what types of behavior are ok. The value of a thick line for me is 30, which is whenever the checkbox is checked. My slider has a max value of 60. Say, I check the checkbox and then move the slider to some value that is not 30, for example, 48. Then I uncheck the checkbox and then check it again. Should the thickness pick up where it left off at (48) or is it ok for it to default back to 30 even though that's not where the slider is currently at?	I made it so my  thickness slider only works when the thickness checkbox is checked however after turning the checkbox on i have to slide my slider before it changes the thickness even if the slider was already on a value that should make it thicker. Is this fine?	for my thickness slider, I have implemented it so that the slider only works when the checkbox is checked. I have implemented it in a way so that when the checkbox is unchecked, the slider is empty (all white). However, the slider only become empty when i click on the slider after the checkbox has been unchecked (it does not become empty as soon as the checkbox is unchecked). Is this ok? 	I am trying to create the slider widget in the paint file similar to how I did checkbox, but it is saying that my slider function is unbound. I checked to see if I passed in checkbox somewhere else in the files, but it isn't called anywhere other than where the widget is formed.	I’m trying to further differentiate the slider from the checkbox itself to the point where if the checkbox is ticked, there will always be a thicker line compared to what the current thickness of the lines are. Is this not ok? "

In the borders part of imagemanipulation, what does renumbering mean? Do I need to shift all pixels left by a certain border number and down by a certain border number? 

	My implementation of border passes the tests. But when I click the border button, I get an array index out of bounds. What does this mean?	When I click border multiple times on the GUI, it seems as if a border is made around an image, making the border larger and image appearingly smaller relative to the border. Should this be the functionality of the border function?	Hey, so I was just in office hours with this issue, and they told me to post my problem on Piazza. I've done everything up through task 5, but my border function is still not working. I wrote a test case called border_big that is just like border_small but with a 2x3 matrix instead. My border_small test is passing, but my border_big is failing. I get the same error when I run my test, and when I run the GUI and try to click the border button. Two TA's looked at it and went through my math and implementation with me, but neither could find the issue. Here's a picture of my border function and the errors I get when running my test and running GUI.

Test Failure: 
GUI Failure: 
	For border, I know we create a larger image than before, but is the new picture just the original with the border added to the edges? or is it a slightly larger image, where the border is covering the edges? i.e. if a picture of a dog is 240 x 240 and there's a 10-pixel border, is the resulting dog part of the picture just 240x240 with a 10-pixel border? or a 250x250 dog with the border covering the edges? 

thanks. 	and are we allowed to draw our bordered image as the original image on top of a rectangle of borderColor? or should the border be a true border in the sense that where the image lies, it is empty? 	I have implemented the border method and it passes the test in MyTest, but when I press the border button in the GUI, it adds a white border not a black border. I do not know why this is since I have not changed any of the code in GUI. Do you have any ideas of where to look to fix the problem? Or is it ok since it passes the test in MyTest?

Thanks!	I believe I have the right code, but when i run it (the border one and the contrast one) they do not respond. There is no difference before and after I implement border and contrast. I attached a screenshot for my border code. I wonder what's wrong with this part of my code. (I post this only visible to instructors so I assume it's ok to paste a portion of my code)	In my game, I am trying to have borders around square objects, but when I run everything, it paints the color I wanted the squares to be drawn as but not the borders. I figure I'm probably using borders wrong, but I don't see how. I am drawing the border in the same function where I draw the squares. I draw the border first.

I know we're supposed to throw an exception, can I throw one in my catch block?	@Test(expected = NoSuchElementException.class)
public void testGetNextTokenWordEmpty() throws IOException {

What should we do to catch multiple exceptions? The above works to catch both exceptions, but is this the correct way? What is the difference between putting an exception next to @Test and putting in the method stub?

"	I'm getting the error ""java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class Pixel"" in my console...is this the same problem?
	So I'm testing getComponents( ) in pixel, and I'm running into an error that sort of looks like this:



What I'm doing is calling ""assertEquals"" on an array that I created, as well as a pixel.getComponents( ) which should be an array also. But I feel like rather than checking for equivalency of contents, I'm checking for equivalency of the *memory location* of pixel.getComponents( ) and the array I've created.

So... would it be appropriate if I ran a for loop and checked for assertEquals between each integer of the array?	to clarify, the color map maps a pixel to the number of times that pixel's color values occur in the image, right?	I'm getting the following error when I try to run my buttons. I checked the line that's highlighted and I can't really figure out what's wrong/

java.lang.StackOverflowError
	at Pixel.&lt;init&gt;(Pixel.java:84)
		I'm not sure how that works. To return the red value of a pixel we still need a pixel, right?	in the reducePalette function is says the param pic is the Pixel for which the closest match should be found and the return is the most closely matched pixel. However, the type for pic is PixelPicture (and not Pixel) and as is the return type. Should we be returning the whole PixelPicture or just a Pixel?	Here's how I'm setting up my distance function in Pixel:
//Find each pixel difference        int redPix = Math.abs(px.r - Pixel.r);         int greenPix = Math.abs(px.b-Pixel.b);        int bluePix = Math.abs(px.b-Pixel.b);                //Return sum        return (redPix+greenPix+bluePix);
I'm getting warnings that the static field should be accessed in a static way. What do they mean and how can I fix these warnings?	That I actually had a question about. The notes say to compare pixel px that's being passed in with another pixel but I'm not sure what pixel that is? Where is it being declared?	Do we actually need to worry about this in this method? Won't our pixel constructor automatically handle this exception for us?	Both these functions are passing in a pixel px and we are comparing them to ""another pixel"" e.g. ""@param px The pixel being compared with this"", but I'm unsure as to what this other pixel is??

Is this a pixel that would be declared outside of the function? To test this function, would we declare this pixel outside of the method call for dist/equals?	What you're saying makes sense, however one of my tests is still failing and I'm unsure as to why:

Here is a fake implementation to test the null case:

  @Test    public void testPixelDistanceNull() {        Pixel p = new Pixel(-140, 150, 230);         int[] nullArray = null;         Pixel px = new Pixel (nullArray);        assertEquals(-1, p.distance(px));    }

And here is the constructor implementation:

  public int distance(Pixel px) {        //Null test        if (px == null){                return -1;            }                    else {                        return 2;            }            }
But it's failing, why?	I didn't understand the 
rotateCW_small() test because the smallSquare is 
{Pixel.BLACK, Pixel.BLUE},
            {Pixel.RED,   Pixel.GREEN} so shouldn't it be 
{Pixel.RED, Pixel.BLACK},
            {Pixel.GREEN,   Pixel.BLUE} when rotated clockwise? In the test case it is 
{Pixel.BLUE, Pixel.GREEN},
            {Pixel.BLACK,   Pixel.RED} which is the case for counter clock wise rotation.	Eclipse tells me ""The value of the field Pixel.r is not used."" Same with the values of Pixel.g, Pixel.b.
Is this fine? 

Also, are curly brackets necessary following my if and else statements?

Thanks so much :)	The description of reducePalete in our Java file reads

* @param pic The Pixel for which the closest match should be found.
     * @return The most closely matched Pixel from the palette.

but based on the instructions it seems like we take in an original picture and a number of colors on our palette
then returning a new picture with a reduced amount of colors.

Just wanted to verify is this correct?	In Pixel, all the methods after the constructors require us to reference the instance variables. How do we access these? Something like this.pixel. How can we reference the the red/green/blue values? The int[] we create in the constructor is only available inside the constructor method. 	My current implementation just uses boatloads of if statements to check if a pixel is one that I care about. But then I realized I end up skipping some pixels. The resulting function will run and create a blurry picture but it's not using all of the pixels within the radius to do so. 

For instance in the following picture my function will take pixels marked with O but skip those with X. Center pixel to average around is C. And so on for each ""concentric"" box in the radius.

O X O X O
X O O O X
O O C  O O
X O O O X
O X O X O

How can I iterate over each concentric box without missing any pixels?	In order to hit every pixel in the box  I think I have to relate the two for loops to each other. Is something like this sensible:

for (int j = 1; j &lt;= radius; j++)
    	{ 
    		for (int i = 1; i &lt;= j ; i++)
    		{    			
	    		if (x-i &gt;= 0) //boundary checking on every box
	    		{
	    			Pixel a = src[x-i][y];
	    			if (component == 0)
	    			{
	    			tempColor = a.getRed();
	    			}
	    			if (component == 1)
	    			{
	    			tempColor = a.getGreen();
	    			}
	    			if (component == 2)
	    			{
	    			tempColor = a.getBlue();
	    			}
	    			componentTotal += tempColor;
	    			count++;   			
	    		}
and I have 8 blocks for the possibilities for 
Pixel a = src[x-i][y]
Namely:
x-i , y
x+i, y
x , y-i
x, y+i
x-i , y-i
x+i , y-i
x-i , y+i
x+i , y+i


This current version isn't passing the Junit test.	For blur, if the radius around a pixel would take you out of bounds in one direction instead of another, do you take the average of a non-square rectangle of pixels?

E.g. if you called blur on (2,1) with a radius of 2, would you be averaging the rgb values of (0,0) through (4,3) inclusive? 	I am confused how blur works. I understand the instructions that given a radius, the neighboring pixels around a pixel must be averaged. But if the objective is to blur the entire PixelPicture, what is the purpose of the radius? How do we know what the center pixel of the neighboring pixels are?	My Pixel class passes all the tests I have written. Anything else it could possibly be?  	I've constructed a colormap using the code from ColorMap.java 
Map&lt;Pixel, Integer&gt; m = new TreeMap&lt;Pixel, Integer&gt;()
and I've been adding in each pixel using the put() method on my way to generating the frequency but I still don't know what to put as the int input 	Hey y'all, any help with my runtime would be really appreciated.

To fill my colorMap, I first start with two outer loops to traverse the width and height of the picture (w and h). Then, I use pixel p[w][h] and compare ""p"" with every previous pixel q (up until the point I reached p) in a nested pair of two inner loops. 

This probably creates a lot of lag.

Anyway, inside my fourth inner loop, I say if(p.equals(q)), then count++, and then count ends up being the ""int"" in my ""put( )"" for the particular pixel ""p.""

How else can I implement a strategy to build my colorMap that doesn't require four loops?

// build the colorMap	For blur, after you average out a box of certain radius around a pixel, do you then go to the next pixel over (ie traverse every pixel in the bitmap)? Or do you go to the next pixel such that its blur box would not intersect the previous blur box?

Thanks,	Does this function return repeated pixels or does it only return the pixel once if it occurs more than once in the array?	One think I did not understand from the other questions: should we blur only the center pixel or all the pixel within the radius?
For example, if the blurRadius is 1 and I am at pixel [4][5], I want to be averaging, [3][4], [3][5], [3][6], [4][4], [4][5], [4][6], [5][4], [5][5], [5][6].
However, should I change the value of the components of all these pixels or only the value of the components of [4][5]?	I see what you are talking about, but i'm confused about how to create a null Pixel when my Pixel constructing is taking in an array?"

I thought all of this was implemented outside of the widget file, however the test cases say otherwise.	let checkbox (init: bool) (s: string)
  : widget * bool value_controller =
  let (widg, lbl) = label s in
  let (widg2, notify) = notifier widg in
  let (widgX, onLbl) = label ""X"" in
  let (widgBlank, offLbl) = label "" "" in
  let rtncontr = make_control init in
  (* add toggle function *)
  let rtncontr.add_change_listener &lt;- (fun () -&gt; not(get_value)) in
  (* Add different visual states for on versus off *)
  let w = widg2.repaint &lt;- (if rtncontr.get_value then hpair [widgX, space, lbl] 
                            else hpair [widgBlank, space, lbl] )in
  (w, rtncontr)
I don't understand how to add a function to the add_change_listener field in this instance of my record. The compiler doesn't understand what I am trying to do at all.

Thanks

I have been working on the code, but have only gotten this far and I don't really know how to proceed. Any tips or help will be greatly appreciated as I have spent hours trying to figure out how to do these parts of the funciton. From what I understand, the basic structure/what needs to be done in the widget is:

1: make widget;  2: add a repaint function if get_value then _ else _ 3: add label;  4: add notifier;  5: create make_control init;  6: add_change_listener fun() -&gt; not (get_value) (i.e. toggle)

I don't know if I am just not understanding the syntax, or completely misunderstanding what portions of this ""checkbox"" method the checkbox function should be doing/how/where it should be doing it."

"	Gotcha, so we are assuming here that the map (or list in this case) is already sorted?	val get : 'k -&gt; ('k,'v) map -&gt; 'v option

private Map&lt;Pixel, Integer&gt; m = new TreeMap&lt;Pixel, Integer&gt;();

Is this initializing a new color map?

In the reduce palette function, do we need to initialize our own color map or can we just call m.put() to add mappings?	If a pixel p is already present in the map and i call map.put(p, 1), will the int value associated with p increment to 2? I'm not sure how the int value you pass in to the function affects the map.	if you call map.put(p, 2) then would the map now store both (p, 1) and (p,2)? is there a way to ""override"" the first call (p, 1) if so?	I read through task 2, and I remember that I have to override Equals at some point to test for more than just referential equality. Reading through the different collections, it says that for TreeMap and TreeSet, ""the ordering maintained by a tree map/set, like any sorted mapset, and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided, must be consistent with equals if this sorted map/set is to correctly implement the Map/Set interface."" Does this mean that once I override the equals method, these two collections will not work the way they are supposed to? 
Also, would all three suggested collections work? It's just that one would be better than the others, right?	Is there any way to use a for each loop on a map?	Sorry for lack of explanation — I replaced ""LinkedHashMap"" with just ""Map,"" then iterated through the Map to get specific entries (like high scores) from the converted Map.

  name. This is done in ""solution"" order, or the order that the

  the 2D array of file name is created it is used to create a 2D
  array of images. This is also done with a nested for loop that 
  stores the images in ""solution"" order. The 2D array of images
  is then used to create a linked list of puzzle pieces (which
  are defined with an image and position) that will be keep track
  of the current state of the board. 

Design Concept 2: The second design concept I used was Collections. I used a 
  linked list of puzzle pieces to represent the current state of
  the board and and the final solution. I also used a linked list 
  of strings to represent the names of the winning players and 
  their respective scores. The list of puzzle pieces used to 
  represent the state of the board is shuffled at the beginning 
  of the game and changes with each move the player makes. 
 After each move the ""solution"" linked list is compared with this linked
  list, and if they are equal, the player has won. After the player 
  has won, their name and respective move count is added to two
  separate text documents, ""Names.txt"" and ""Scores.txt."" The names 
  and scores from these text documents are then read into respective 
  linked lists of strings and can be sorted and manipulated from there.

I just want to double-check that my Design Concepts are okay. Thanks!

Description of game: This is a picture-slider game comprised of a 3X3 grid.The objective of the game is to move the puzzle pieces into the empty space to unscramble the puzzle. This is done by using the arrow keys. The game tracks how many moves you have made and displays it at the top. When you complete the puzzle, you will be asked for your name but only the top 3 names and scores will be displayed when the ""High Scores"" button is pressed. The highest score is the user who takes the least amount of moves to complete the puzzle. You can restart the puzzle at any time by hitting the ""Reshuffle"" button. Additionally, an ""Easy Reshuffle"" button has been added for testing purposes. Clicking the ""Instructions"" button will show a window with instructions for the game. There is also an undo function


Design Concept 1: The first design concept I used is 2D arrays. I used 2D arrays to store the file names and images as well as in the fillFiles method and the fillImages method. 2D arrays were used because they were logically connected to the end state of the board, when the puzzle has been solved. My program works by filling a 2D array called files with strings that represent the file name. This is done in ""solution"" order, or the order that the pictures are supposed to be in when the game is solved. Once the 2D array of file name is created it is used to create a 2D array of images. This is also done with a nested for loop that stores the images in ""solution"" order. The 2D array of images is then used to create a linked list of puzzle pieces (which are defined with an image and position) that will be keep track of the current state of the board.

I also used a linked list of strings to represent the names of the winning players and their respective scores. The list of puzzle pieces used to represent the state of the board is shuffled at the beginning of the game and changes with each move the player makes. After each move the ""solution"" linked list is compared with this linked list, and if they are equal, the player has won. After the player has won, their name and respective move count is added to two separate text documents, ""Names.txt"" and ""Scores.txt."" The names and scores from these text documents are then read into respective linked lists of strings and can be sorted and manipulated from there. Collections are also used to implement the ""undo"" function. All of the game states, which are originally stored as a linked list, are stored in a linked list of linked lists. When the user wants to go back, the current state is set back to the previous list that was stored

Design Concept 3: The third design concept I used was File I/O. I used this to implement the high score function of my game. I had three separate files, ""Names.txt"" ""Scores.txt"", and ""highScores.txt."" Names.txt held the individual names of the winners, and scores held the respective move count of the user. Thus, the order of scores and names were related, the user in the first line of the names file had the moves count in the first line of the scores file. The names in the names file were read into a linked list of names using a Scanner. Similarly, the scores in the scores file were read into a linked list of integers. After this was done, the list of scores was sorted by a bubble sort method, and the names list followed the same changes the score list underwent. Lastly, the sorted files were read into the ""highScores"" text file in a certain format. When the high score button was pressed, only the top 3 scores are displayed.


Design Concept 4: The fourth design concept I used was J-Unit testing. I uesd J-Unit tests to test the basic functions in by ""GameBoard"" file. tests were made to ensure the the 2D array of files was being filled correctly. Additionally, methods such as reposition, easy shuffle, fill names, fill score, and sort names and scores were tested."

Just wanted to make sure I'm understanding all of this correctly.

In question 3, are we scaling the original r, g, b values or the difference between r, g, b, and average color intensity?
	When calculating average color intensity, do we cast it to an int or leave it as a double?	In adjustContrast, if we subtract the average color intensity from each component, we sometimes get a negative number. Am I understanding the problem incorrectly?	Does ""number of pixels"" refer to the amount of pixels of the whole picture (ie. w * h)?

1. Find the average color intensity of the picture.
     *    a) Sum the values of all the color components for each pixel.
     *    b) Divide the total by the number of pixels times the number of
     *       components (3).	Hey y'all

So I'm still kind of confused. How does the equation for contrast actually work?

Let's say our photo consists of 3 pixels: A (100, 150, 200), B (50, 100, 150) and C (0, 50, 100). When we sum all the values of all the color components in all of the pixels and divide it by three, do we create a new pixel ""p"" within the for loop that would produce a new pixel A of (150, 150, 150) and B of (100, 100, 100) and C of (50, 50, 50) [since the average of all three numbers in A, B, and C are 150, 100 and 50 respectively]. Or... do we add all the R components (100, 50, 0) and label the average color intensity of R as 50 (and G as 100, and B as 150)?

When we subtract the average color intensity from each color component of each pixel, for pixel A.getRed ( ) would that produce 100 - 50 [the average color intensity of R] or would that produce 100 - 150 [the average color intensity of pixel A]? Then, we multiply final result by multiplier, right?

Sorry for the long question, I've been a little bit confused by this problem in particular.

And then for the reduceColorPalette, I just wanted to know if we were supposed to use ColorMap to create our color palette.

——— INSTRUCTIONS ———
Find the average color intensity of the picture.Sum the values of all the color components in all of the pixels.Divide the total by the number of pixels times 3 (the number of components). This is the average color intensity.Subtract the average color intensity from each color component of each pixel, resulting in a ""normalized"" color component. (This will make the average color intensity for the entire image zero.)Scale each normalized color component by multiplying them by the contrast ""multiplier"" parameter. Note that the multiplier is a double (a decimal value like 1.2 or 0.6) and normalized color values are integers.
	For step 1,  it states:

1. Find the average color intensity of the picture.     *    a) Sum the values of all the color components for each pixel.     *    b) Divide the total by the number of pixels times the number of     *       components (3).

Does this mean that after we get the bitmap,  in a for-loop, we sum the rgb components of each pixel and divide by the total number of pixels times 3? Like:

Is this sufficient? 	This is the page that opens up when I click the hyperlink about making a jar file for Junit
	I also can't figure out how to put the jar file at the top level. When I added external jar to my project, it automatically put the jar into the JUnit folder.
	When I added an external jar file to the project, it automatically added it to the JUnit folder. Eclipse is not letting me put the Jar file to the top level. 
	If you are using JUnit testing in your code, you will need to include a .jar file for the JUnit libraries. (We installed one for you in the codio account.)

I see this in the instruction page for this homework. So if I am using eclipse, should I go to the codio account and import it into my project before I export it to submit?

I am a little bit confuse. Since we also have tests in previous homeworks, but I have never purposely include a .jar file.	I added the JUnit library to my Eclipse project. How do I run JUnit tests on the test file that is in my test folder?	Wait so just double checking--I don't remember adding the jar file to my thing, and I definitely did not submit it in the zip, but when I turn it in my JUnit tests pass, so does this mean that the jar was in there? Or will I lose points for not manually adding a jar for JUnit?	If we are submitting the Jar file for JUnit along with our code, do we need to edit the second line of the Makefile?	Hi, I'm not exactly sure what this means. I followed the instructions have a junit.jar in my JUNIT 4 in my project. What should I do with this?

I realized I didn't double check my logic for that test case. But why do the tests in tree.ml get run when I run vocab.ml?	I know this question has been asked before, but I've implemented a few functions in listset.ml and for some reason they're showing up as unimplemented even after scrolling up all the way to the top where it says OLSet.

"	I think I might be misunderstanding the question. Since a set in OLSet must satisfy the invariants then the set is already a list which is sorted in ascending order andcontains no duplicate elements, so I don't understand why any leveraging of the invariants to make this code as efficient as possible is necessary because the set is the same representation as the desired list. Similarly, for the equals function in OLSet the invariants mean that each set has one unique representation as a list so it seems like I can just check s = t, but I feel like this isn't the correct answer/approach. Am I thinking about the invariance of the OLSet incorrectly?	Does this mean that our test cases should not test lists that do not follow the invariants? For example, in my initial tests, I wrote
let s = set_of_list [1; 2; 2; 3].  If we simply make the list_of_set function equal to the input itself, then this would create a set that doesn't satisfy the additional invariants for the OLSet. So should our tests not include lists that do not satisfy the invariants?	In problem 6, in add and remove, are we supposed to check for the invariants (that there are no duplicates and list is sorted) or do we assume that the list that is input into these functions already follows these invariants?	What are the invariants of a queue?	Is it necessary for our implementations to follow the invariants even when we are inside a function call? As in, the output follows the invariants but during processing, it might not be following the invariants.	What are the invariants for the simple queue?"
"	Hi!

I followed the instructions: ""What if the client tries to join a channel they are already a part of?...In cases like this, it is safe to “ignore” the error and process the command as usual.""

However, inside the client/server window, there is a slight variation in the display when the user tries to join a channel they just created. Is this a problem? (Pictures attached showing the change in display: ""user1 created the channel"" --&gt; ""user1 joined"")







	What should we return if a user tries to join a channel they are already a member of?  Should we return a broadcast to 0 people, return an error, or return a broadcast with the user joining the channel again?	Should the inviteCommand broadcast also return the name of the user who was invited to join the channel?

The instructions say that invite is the equivalent of join for private channels, and all users in the channel (including the one who joined) are notified when a join occurs, so I think the answer is yes but the directions don't explicitly state that. 	On the instructions for JoinCommand, it says 
""What if the client tries to join a channel they are already a part of? The resulting model state should be no different than the original, which means we do not need to protect the server state from this sort of error. In cases like this, it is safe to “ignore” the error and process the command as usual.""

Does that mean that I don't need to check if the user is already in the channel? Are the only things I need to check before registering the user and broadcasting the name method 1) whether the channel that user wants to join is one of the existing channels 2) whether the channel is public for the user to join ?	I was wondering what type of broadcast, if any, I should return if a user wants to join a channel they are already in?	If a user that we haven't registered tries to join a channel, do we return an error? The instructions in JoinCommand only have two error statements, but wouldn't this return a No Such User error?	What if the client tries to join a channel they are already a part of? The resulting model state should be no different than the original, which means we do not need to protect the server state from this sort of error.

I'm stuck because it's an error if a user is in the channel already, but you need to return a Broadcast. Is there a type of broadcast that doesn't do anything?"

"	My line preview works like normal except when I drag the mouse off the canvas and release the mouse outside of the canvas the preview line does not go away unless I click the canvas again. Is this normal behavior or does this mean there's a bug in my code?	When I am in ""preview mode"" (aka) dragging my mouse around, then I move my mouse outside the canvas and unpress my mouse, the line stays. Also when I move my mouse back over the canvas it still tracks my mouse though I am not dragging which clearly breaks the program. Can I get a hint at how I can fix this?	I'm still a little confused on how to do this. I have a couple of thoughts. If you're ""dragging an element"" then that should involved preview right? But then how do you draw something outside of the paint canvas?	How the Paint should work when we drag the shape outside of the canvas and release it there? 	When I begin dragging one of my color sliders and then continue to drag onto the canvas, a line is drawn on the canvas. I've been trying to fix this by changing paint_action at the MouseDown and MouseDrag pattern matches to add a conditional of if the mouse is in the canvas or not when it begins dragging (using Widget.event_within), but I can't figure out where to put this conditional, or even if this is the correct way to be going about this issue.	No, it's only once I click outside the canvas (MouseDown) and then begin dragging, and while the mouse is still down, I move the mouse over the canvas. Also, I just realized that it does not only happen when I first have MouseDown on the sliders, it happens whenever I start dragging outside the canvas.	When I am in PointMode and start dragging from outside the canvas and then go onto the canvas, points are drawn on the canvas. I had the same issue with lines, but lines have LineStartMode and LineEndMode, so I could make sure that LineEndMode only happened when LineStartMode happened after MouseDown. I can't handle this issue in the same way because there is not PointStartMode and PointEndMode, so how can I make sure that PointMode only happens when MouseDown happened within the canvas?"

If the automatic grader sayd I got 90/100, does that mean I attained the maximum score possible? Or am I missing 10 points somewhere	How/ when do we find out the points we've received for style and testing on our homeworks?	So I won't get any points off for submitting this?	my code wont compile because I removed the kudos problem on deque.ml becuase it had an error without me touching it; how many points will we lose for our code not compiling
	My phone unexpectedly died during lecture today and I was only able to do (i think 2-3) polls.

Or see what we got points off for in terms of style specifically for hw 2? 	Does Q2 kudo problem int_refs_aliased worth points?	Will we get points off if we don't? Will it be considered inefficient?	Does style matter for the midterm? If a question asks us to implement a function and we do it in a less efficient way than the solution posted will we lose points?	For adding Points to the deque in paint_action, (Task 3, ""Extending the Shape Type"") how would I add a list of points? In other words, how would I get access to all the points that I pass when I am dragging my mouse?	How do you pass in c (color) on the right side of the points(c,ps) match case? I tried using with_params g c (just like how it was done in draw_line) but I get an unbound value error.	When creating some points and storing that to paint.preview, how do I actually pass in the position list to some points??	I implemented the thick lines, and it's working properly with the lines and ellipses, but for some reason my points are still thin when thick lines is on.
Is there a problem with my code or is Graphics.plot just defined to be ""immune"" to the line width?	My point button is working but my line button does not even though I was drawing lines earlier. I think *maybe* the lines I draw are being added to the paint.shapes because if for example I drag two streams of points and then draw two lines, if I click undo three times, it ""does nothing"" for the first two clicks and then undoes the most recent stream of points- is this because of my pattern matching in paint_action? 	Are point/points not supposed to be able to be thicc-ified?	But the set_line_width documentation states that it will ""Set the width of points and lines drawn with the functions above.""

Does this still mean we don't need to change thickness of points in our implementation? I know in practice you can't even see the difference anyways but still wondering	I finished implementing drawing points, but my points do not appear where I am clicking. Instead, they appear further down on the canvas. I am not sure why this is happening.	As I drag my points, the distances between them adjust as I keep moving, and once I release it changes again and sort of settles into a final shape. Is that supposed to happen? 	paint.points holds the point list in a mutable state that can easily be accessed. 	Do we need to have something that displays what tool (line, points, etc) is currently selected like in the example?	Would these points be style points?	I just wanted to check:

When I draw a bunch of points at once (so when I press down on the mouse, drag, and then release) and then hit the undo button, all of the points that I produced while dragging are undone. Is this the correct implementation for undo on points?	I see that it draws individual points now. Is it supposed to also draw a line of points?	Right but do we need a pattern matching case for PointMode? Because presumably, the erasure of the points during the last drag happens with the (Deque.remove_tail paint.shapes); command or am I wrong?	When I draw points, they show up far below the canvas and when I drag up the points go down, and vice versa. Not really sure why this is happening	Yes I did that and the points move down if I move my mouse up (still doesn't necessarily stay on the canvas)	Some of my code runs over the vertical line in OCaml because of the length of some of my variable names. Would I get points off for style?	The preview function for line and points both work except that the first line and points won't have previews. The previews only show up after the first usage and I'm not sure why?	so just to clarify- it's okay that while the mouse is being dragged the points aren't appearing? it's only when I release my mouse when all the points appear	What is meant by setting the color in the graphics context for points (task 3), this probably has a really simple answer. I'm using black as a placeholder.	when I drag my points, it doesn't create a curve or continuous line- maybe because theres a bit of a lag but if I drag it quickly the resulting line is pretty dotted. is that okay?	The points I draw when the thicker mode don't seem that much thicker than when the paint program is in the less thick mode. Is this expected?	Some of these questions are manually graded for 10+ points. What are the things we should consider (efficiency, robustness, whether it works?).	Is there a limit on line length for style points or do we just limit it to what you can fit without scrolling?

	Should it then be pointing to the same some bubble as what head points to?	On 5b of November 2017, would we get points off if we returned an illegal argument exception if beginIndex &gt;= array.length?

I'm a little confused why for the final u.produce() the result is 2. I think both s and t are pointing to the same counter because it's defined outside of new_increasing, but I'm not sure why the third produce is 2.	Hi y'all,

For this problem pictured below, is the reason why the second line of testing does not run because each run of the test calls s.produce( ) again?
So i.e. the second line of testing would expect:
s.produce( ) = 0
s.produce( ) = 1
s.produce( ) = 2
s.produce( ) = 3
when in fact what would actually be produced (popped off the stream) would be:
s.produce( ) = 4
s.produce( ) = 5
s.produce( ) = 6
s.produce( ) = 7
which is why this test would fail?

Or is this reasoning wrong? :'(

	Dear All,

I'm not sure how this function works! For mk_buffered, we're ""popping off"" the first element in the list when we call produce, right? And I get that we're supposed to return the first element in the stream when we call produce.
(1) So why do we need to ""rewrite"" the produce function?
(2) Also, why can't we just write ""let ans &lt;- s.produce( ); ans""?
(3) I also thought we were supposed to produce both a 'a stream and a 'a buffered... but instead I feel like all we're doing is returning ""s.produce( )"" and I don't even know what type ""s.produce( )"" is :P

Thoughts on these questions dearly appreciated ~

	Like when we call b.peek(), buf.contents gets called right? But doesn't buf.contents get changed to s.produce(), meaning s.produce() is incremented once? Then if we call b.peek() again, shouldn't the s.produce() be affected? "

Hi, If I implement high scores by recursively sorting the scores, will this count for both recursion and IO File?Thank you	Can we implement reading and writing high scores to be exclusive to a specific text file in the program folder rather than being a generic text file from anywhere in our system so that I can avoid having to enter the filepath every time I want to load the scores? 

This approach would still implement reading and writing to a text file using a custom format, but it would automate the process instead of requiring a save and load button. Thanks!	Hi, I just wanted to clarify what would be a valid use of I/O as a design concept. I am using I/O for high scores and will have a high scores file. I have a players class that I store in an ArrayList with the name and score and before each game I read in the file using a FileReader and BufferedReader and add to an array and then after the game is done I add the current user's name and score to the array and write it to the file and print the high scores. Is this a valid use? 	I'm confused on how I would use out.write() to change the file I have with the high scores?	I have a file in my program that stores the high scores in my game. I read from and write to that file. However, every time I close out of the game, the contents of the file delete. So the next time I open the game, I can't get access to any of the scores from previous games. Do you have any tips for me? Thank you!	I do not use collections right after file IO though--I am using a linked list to sort high scores after my file information has already been read in and stored in a Map. I thought that doing this was separate from the file IO process itself, since it is a step that can be taken away and the file IO would still work perfectly. Would this be okay?	So if you're trying to implement the high scores feature, should the game:
(1) read a file with other high scores or a blank file
(2) ask the user to input their first name, last name, age at the start of the game
(3) when the game ends, stores their information and the score earned and sorts them 
(4) writes out the revised file
(5) displays it somewhere on the game

is this correct? or do we not have to ask for the user's input? 	I discovered that when my text file to which I write high scores is outside the ""files"" folder, everything works fine, but I start getting IOExceptions when I move the text file into the ""files"" folder. Do you know why that's happening and what I should do? Should my high scores file not go inside that ""files"" folder?"

Thank you!	Hi, I'm failing testNickBroadcastsToChannelWhereMember, and in particular, this line:

In specific, the trace says:
java.lang.AssertionError: broadcast expected:&lt;{Duke=[:User0 NICK Duke], User1=[:User0 NICK Duke]}&gt; but was:&lt;{Duke=[:User0 NICK Duke]}&gt;

I'm having trouble understanding what that AssertionError means. I tried printing out my recipients for the broadcast, and it says both User0 and User1 are in the set of recipients. Here's my changeNickname code in ServerModel. Really appreciate any help on how to make sense of that error.
public Set&lt;String&gt; changeNickname(int userId, String newNickname) {
    	Set&lt;String&gt; recipients = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;();
    	
    	allUsers.put(userId, newNickname);

I'm kind of confused about 1.a in 2016.

So we begin with an ASM that has qn1 with v1 pointing to none and qn2 with v2 pointing to v2. All good.

Okay next we have ""let qn3 : int qnode = qn1."" Does this mean it points to the same node that qn1 points to in the heap (the first box at the top right in the photo?) Or... does qn3 create a new node with the same attributes as qn1: { v = 1; next = None }?

(2)
At the bottom, head now points to Some { v = 3; next = Some qn3 }. Okay. Some qn3, if it's a new node, would have { v = 3; next = qn2 } right? If it was the same node as the one qn1 pointed to, would qn1 just change to { v = 3; next = None }?

"	I decided to implement the RGB color sliders for task 6. I was wondering if we would penalized for not coloring the red slider red, the green slider green, etc.

Thanks!	I was wondering how to get around the fact the update for the slider is continually calling after you make an event handler to handle the slider when trying to make the color buttons work simultaneously with the color sliders. Thank you	In paint.ml, I am trying to update the fields of paint.color. I am trying to do this by calling add_change_listener on a slider's state (for example the red slider state) and passing in a function that takes in type int and returns type unit. In this function, I am trying to modify paint.color by updating the field of interest (in this case, the red field) with the int value being passed in. For example, if I'm passing in n, and the original fields of paint.color were {cr; cg; cb}, I want to update the fields to be {w; cg; cb}.

The only issue I'm running into is how to access the fields of paint.color so I can use the original value in updating the final values.	I'm still not sure why modifying paint.color with a function that creates a color from inputted red green and blue values doesn't work. I created a reference for red blue and green and change the values whenever the corresponding color's slider is moved. 	Hello!

In implementing my color slider, I wanted it such that my red value for the color is 255 * a fraction representing where I am in the slider in relation to the entire slider bar. 

However, the fraction often comes out as a decimal value, but rgb values can't be decimals.

How do you cast on Ocaml and are we allowed to?

Thank You :D 	I'm currently implementing three different sliders for each of r g and b. When I slide say the r slider, I'd want to use the with keyword with the new color (with updated r value), but then how do I get the current g and b values such that I can update the entire triple?
	When trying to change the color with sliders, I am attempting to change the r, g, b values of paint.color within each slider, but this doesn't seem to be working. I don't see why this wouldn't work, but I'm wondering if I have to change something in gctx or if I can do it all in paint. If I can do it all in paint, should I be updating the rgb values for color in a different location?	I know this is not a necessary feature for the assignment, but I am trying the adjust the values of my rgb sliders so that when I use the color buttons, the values of the sliders adjust. This seems like it would be a simple change of the slider values to the rgb of the new color, but I don't know how to externally change the slider values since I can't access the value controllers outside of the sliders themselves.	In my red color slider, I want to update the paint.color to a record {r,g,b} where g and b are the current values of paint.color and r is the new value determined by the slider.  I understand how to update the r value, but how do I access the current b and g values? I tried something like paint.color.g but that does not work.  "

I imported the homework files to the src folder, and under the problems tab, there is a description ""Errors (100 of 162 items)"".

So even without making any changes in Simple Manipulations, the rotateCW test should pass in the Mytest.java, since it is already implemented for us, right? Since that test isn't passing I assume it is because of the image path not being correct.

‎⁨""Macintosh\ HD⁩/⁨Users⁩/myname/eclipse-workspace⁩/cis120_hw/""

Why are my test classes seemingly unaware of my non-test classes? I tried creating a new project and I followed the steps as they appear on the Eclipse Setup Powerpoint (adding the JUnit 4 library to my project, importing the unzipped homework folder into my src folder, building a path for my test folder that uses it as a source folder, etc.) but I can't seem to fix the problem. What gives?	I have an exclamation mark on the src folder, I don't know how to fix this.

	when i try to create a new source folder, eclipse just creates a regular folder - is there a way to fix this?	Ok--that's probably it, but I dont see where on the FAQ it talks about setting source folders and that isn't in the setup... I can't do any of that path building stuff, and when I right click on source or test, I only have the option of creating a new source folder which does nothing. When I run the tests, it runs the tests from hw 6 and they all fail (even though they passed when I ran them before submission).	Is client (the folder containing just hw07-client.jar) supposed to be a regular folder or a source folder?

I also went through and deleted all the idea related files so that only the readme, test, src and files folders exist and they are all part of the source files However, I still get the error.
	Does that mean I can or cannot organize them into different packages under the src folder? 	Hello! I haven't submitted my code yet, but when I do, will it be a problem that my test folder is called src/test instead of test:

Thanks!	I can only get my code to access image files when I put them in a nested folder in the src folder or if I set the file path to find the images as the entire file path (as opposed to /files/..)

We're not supposed to do the first one bc it'll mess up the compiler and I'm guessing the second won't work either because whoever is running it (or the server compiler?) will have different file directories.

Does anyone know how to deal with this?	When I put my highscores.txt and dictionary.txt files into the ""files"" folder, I get file IO exceptions. Is it okay If I leave those files outside in the main folder? If not, how can I prevent this exception?

I just created my java project and imported the hw file according to the instructions. However, I ran into the same 'pennstagram/.settings' already exists problem in @2077. 

After importing, I ran the project. When I clicked on RotateCW or any other pre-written function, eclipse throws a nullpointerexception. Since I have not altered any code at all, I am not sure what to do or what caused this.
