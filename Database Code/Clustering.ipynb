      "Hi! I was registered half an hour ago for both the lecture and recitation and just tried to switch my recitation to better fit my schedule. I dropped my old recitation and when I tried to add a new one the, the system wouldn't let me. I would like to switch into 214, 216, 217, all of which Penn in Touch says are open. I would, at this point, also be happy to take my old spot back, which was in 211, which I believe is now closed. I am very concerned that without the recitation slot, Penn in Touch will soon delete my lecture spot, as well. Could someone please help me re-register for recitation? \n",

My strategy is to accumulate a set of pairs of ints (x, y), which represent the coordinates of the tokens to be flipped, and then to iterate through the set and flip the token at each Pair of coordinates. I created a Pair class to hold these two ints. Initially, I was getting a Class Cast Exception when I tried to add a new Pair to the TreeSet&lt;Pair&gt;, and the error message said it was because Pair doesn't implement Comparable. I didn't think the ability to compare one Pair to another was critical to my program so I used @Override to insert a dummy compareTo method that always returns zero. Now, when I run the whole program, it only ever flips the first token added to the set, and I'm wondering if this is because it cannot compare the Pairs. If so, where can I find a model for writing a good compareTo function or what other ways might I be able to get around this issue? Thank you!\n",

I had three separate files, \"Names.txt\" \"Scores.txt\", and \"highScores.txt.\" Names.txt held the individual names of the winners, and scores held the respective move count of the user. Thus, the order of scores and names were related, the user in the first line of the names file had the moves count in the first line of the scores file. The names in the names file were read into a linked list of names using a Scanner. Similarly, the scores in the scores file were read into a linked list of integers. After this was done, the list of scores was sorted by a bubble sort method, and the names list followed the same changes the score list underwent. Lastly, the sorted files were read into the \"highScores\" text file in a certain format. When the high score button was pressed, only the top 3 scores are displayed.\n",

      "Sorry Jenny, I should’ve been more clear. I didn’t paste all of my code because I was sort of showing the gist logic of my tick() function, which unfortunately didn’t make it easier.So I have a class SnakeBody which basically scores the position and color. And snake is an arraylist of snakebody. When the timer ticks, I added a new SnakeBody to the arraylist in the moving direction by updating x and y (private int fields in GameCourt). So the moving part and eating apples part work perfectly fine but when I’m checking hit wall or hit itself it should’ve stopped 1 box earlier. As you can see in my screenshot, the snake head should’ve stopped right after it hits the body.In my tick(), is this logic right?1. Update snake position2. If eats apple, do something 3. If (hitWall || hitItself) { //die} else { update my board. Repaint the board.}So the new SnakeBody shouldn’t be shown after it hits itself because the repaint method won’t be called. But I was still very confused why the next state is painted as shown in my screenshot.Thank you for your patience and help!!\n",

If the game that was reloaded had 2 flagged cells from the previous game, the user cannot unflag those cells from the previous game.
