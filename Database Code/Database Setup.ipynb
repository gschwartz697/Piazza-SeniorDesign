I haven't looked deeply into the logic you've written, but you should also be very careful with your use of parentheses - a lot of times OCaml gets finicky if you use them in the wrong place or omit them when they should be included - additionally make sure that every open paren has a matching closed paren.

Is there a way to pattern match things onto variables assigned to certain values/strings, or do you just have to use if/then/else statements?\n",

      "2. It would, but I'm still not understanding how writing a helper function would bypass the issue of needing the length of the sequence from the 2nd list because the input into the helper function has to be either l2 in its entirety or just the sequence being matched (which would require the sublist function to pull it out the correct length).\n",
      "1. That's actually exactly what you need to do. This is because you don't care if later terms check, you would just like to see if the first part of the second sequence matches. This takes care of the length issue so you don't have to care.\n",

      "Note that the return type is still generic.  Moreover, by looking at the implementation of fold, we could \"refine\" this return type so that it keeps track of the length of the list that it corresponds to.  Let's write 'b[N] for the generic type as it applies to lists of length [N].  We could then rewrite the type of fold like this:\n",

      "I tested out the mouse_x and mouse_y part, not the event within, but pretty much the implementation works for the first constraint or the area I designated for the first level of thickness. Initially the slider is set to the max value, and I when do a MouseDown event on the area where the thickness is changed to 1, the change that I want to see on the slider happens. However, when I try to do a Mousedown event on the areas for any other area (Thickness = 2,3,4, or 5) it doesn't change at all. I have a series of if statements checking if the mouse_x and mouse_y values are between the constraints. Obviously, it's working for my first constraint, but why not the others?\n",

      "Yes, what I mean is that you should probably be setting the value of the value controller directly to the detected mouse_x position, rather than partitioning the slider into different regions (0-20, 20-40, etc). \n",
      "\n",
      "Handling of the logic of the value set can then be done in through the change_listeners.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if your slider widget has a total width of 100, when you get a mouse_x value, it should be between 0 and 100. You would want to set the value of the value controller to be whatever mouse_x is, and the change_listener functions should handle the logic to divide this by value by 20 to set the line thickness between 0 and 5.\n",
      "What if I don't want the value to be below 1? Sorry for all of the questions, I'm just trying to wrap my head around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the value of your value controller will be between 0 and 100 in the example above, right? This value should just correspond to how far the slider is slid to. You can do whatever you want with these values to change thickness, color, etc.\n",

      "(value / 25) + 1\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea is that the value stored in the value controller should be generic. The way you were approaching it made it so that there could only be values that you partitioned manually, but the slider widget you implement wouldn't be able to generalize to say, the 255 int values for colors.\n",
      "So am I not allowed to give x a set value? (To address the generic point that you mentioned) Or are you saying that x should be equal to the max value? I'm taking the approach where max value is the value I pass in. Is that ok?\n",
      "What is the x you're referring to? The value of the slider? It is fine to initialize it to the value you pass in, but it should change accordingly to indicate the current state of the slider. The key point is that the value stored should represent where the slider is, rather than the final value you want to assign to another property (e.g. thickness, color).\n",

      "\n",
      "You also need to allow a user to draw a series of points at once by dragging their mouse with the button down. After the user releases the mouse button, you need to add all of the points that the user drew to the deque of shapes. (A command to draw a set of points just requires knowledge of the current color, and the points' locations.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you the same person that asked the question or is this an answer? This quote answers the question ---the points are only added when he releases the mouse button \n",
      "Same person asking the question. So when you're dragging the mouse, there should be nothing that shows up on the canvas until you release?\n",
      "The way I understand it is that there should be a preview. Then when you release its \"permanently\" drawn.\n",
      "How do you undo the preview though? For example, with lines, the preview is a line between two points, and the length/direction of that line depends on where you're dragging it. However, with points, because as long as you're dragging the mouse you're creating points, how do you modify that preview? In other words, you can't modify the points that you've already put down, unlike LineMode or EllipseMode, which both result in 1 single shape, right?\n",
      "So the way I understand it (and it feels natural from a UI perspective, though I suppose I could he wrong) is that as you drag a lot of points get \"previewed\" as you move the mouse. No need to modify that, just keep adding a lot of points. Then when you release the mouse those points are added to the deque. And undo removes the entire group of points.\n",
      "Gotcha. Yeah. That's currently what I have. Only add to the deque at the very end (aka mouse up), but until then, just keep adding to preview. \n",

Now lets add another set of inner loops that runs like your original helper did. By the same logic as before, the inner loop runs 10,000 times.

I see why this might work for the current scenario (and have done this in my code), because int is a primitive and Strings are immutable. However, for a general situation, where the members of a collection are general  objects, just copying them over to the new collection would return a shallow copy which contains the references of the objects. Hence, changing the new collection would also change the original one. I think what we would want in a general solution is the creation of a deep copy, which copies every member not by reference, but by creating new members and copying the fields to ensure that only primitives are copied, not reference. If I'm not mistaken, for TreeMap, the functions clone() and putAll() both create shallow copies of the original map.

      "As for the tests, for the first one it looks like you are Broadcasting an error when you shouldn't be. Are you 100% positive you aren't doing that in the Join Update server model method?\n",
      "The second one got cut off in the picture. \n",

      "Well, I didn't see why/how exactly they're failing, so I don't know.\n",
      "Honestly, thinking about exactly what you described in the original post (\"My first thought was to undo all my steps\") my guess is you likely accidently didn't remove everything exactly. That sounds obvious and is obviously very hard to find if you think you did remove everything correctly...but since these tests started failing after you did something, it's probably that thing you did that is causing them to fail, and you may not have perfectly reverted to the old version of your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps the best thing to do is pretend the tests were never passing, and just start going through your code as it is now, trying to find the bugs, and eventually you might stumble on some one thing that's a tiny bit off from when you tried to make changes that is making everything fail. \n",

The view would check on the game model for every new frame, so maybe 30 times per second, while the game model would be running on its own. If this was done without the model being a separate thread, if the view didn't check on the game model during a collision, the collision would be ignored, because the game model would never see the bullet and object at the same point.\n",

For example, every tick, you would update the location of the the bullets and obstacles and also check to see if a collision took place. \n",

Since you're asking how to produce the choice structure of the game anyway, it might be useful to build a tree or graph, which you then traverse to decide where the user is taken next. For example, you start at the beginning of the journey, which is the root, and then the user is given 2 choices. Based on the choice that the user makes, you will either visit the left child or the right child. You could have more than 2 children, if there are more than 2 choices on any screen.

      "My game is basically just a variant on Mario. So my game itself has multiple states even outside the gameplay level itself, namely a menu mode, an instructions mode, a game mode. My GameCourt, when calling a tick and then painting it calls a manager class that is able to figure out what to do (in the tick and repaint) from an abstract gamemode class that is extended by a the menu mode class, the instructions mode class, and the game mode class. This is needed in order to allow for situations where the user's actions and the game's response to the actions are different, and cannot really be done by a single class as each mode differs largely. Each class behaves very differently from the other classes extending gamemode, as each class not only has its own way of drawing out the game and checks for different user inputs, but also interact with different other classes - as in my gamemode class uses animation and level classes to generate the world, while my menu map interacts with a background class to generate itself.

You should think about using a different way to check if it\\'s the head (don\\'t go for structural equality either!)\\nnvm it passed after I added the matching for prev.

Your singleton passes probably because when you add a new element, you set q.head to the same newnode you create, which would make them referentially equal.

Obviously, it's working for my first constraint, but why not the others?\\n\\nHere is the first constraint:\\nelse if Gctx.event_type e = Gctx.MouseDown        then (if ((mouse_x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; mouse_x &lt; 20) &amp;&amp; (mouse_y &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; mouse_y &lt; 20))              then (val_controller.set_value 1)\\nThe other constraints follow a similar format.\\xa0\", \"\\nI think you may be approaching the slider incorrectly. You should be setting continuous values (at least in the integer domain), rather than creating discrete values for different regions of the slider.\\xa0\\nWhere can I go to learn about setting continuous values? Also can you explain what you mean by integers domain?\\nYes, what I mean is that you should probably be setting the value of the value controller directly to the detected mouse_x position, rather than partitioning the slider into different regions (0-20, 20-40, etc).\\xa0\\n\\nHandling of the logic of the value set can then be done in\\xa0through the change_listeners.\\n\\nFor example, if your slider widget has a total width of 100, when you get a mouse_x value, it should be between 0 and 100. You would want to set the value of the value controller to be whatever mouse_x is, and the change_listener functions should handle the logic to divide this by value by 20 to set the line thickness between 0 and 5.\\nWhat if I don't want the value to be below 1? Sorry for all of the questions, I'm just trying to wrap my head around it.\\n\\nSo the value of your value controller will be between 0 and 100 in the example above, right? This value should just correspond to how far the slider is slid to.

The way you were approaching it made it so that there could only be values that you partitioned manually, but the slider widget you implement wouldn't be able to generalize to say, the 255 int values for colors.\\nSo am I not allowed to give x a set value?

For example, with lines, the preview is a line between two points, and the length/direction of that line depends on where you\\'re dragging it.
